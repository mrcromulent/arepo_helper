  3HE cB $The |b spectrum end point energy differs from the {+3}H-{+3}He mass   
  3HE2cB difference due to the recoil energy, the final state of the residual   
  3HE3cB system and the mass of the emitted but not detected anti-electron      
  3HE4cB neutrino. In the table above, most of the references that measured the 
  3HE5cB end point energy (EPE) also put upper limits on the neutrino mass.  An 
  3HE6cB early history of the role that the |b decay of {+3}H has played in     
  3HE7cB attempts to measure the neutrino mass can be found in (1988Ro21). Fig. 
  3HE8cB 1 in this article is a graph of the {+3}H |b spectrum near the EPE for 
  3HE9cB the electron neutrino masses of 0 and 30 eV. Fig. 1 in (2006We03) and  
  3HEacB Fig. 3 in (2013Dr11) show the |b spectrum near the end point energy    
  3HEbcB for electron neutrino masses of 0 and 1 eV. Modern refinements of these
  3HEccB measurements have resulted in the upper limit of the electron neutrino 
  3HEdcB mass being just over 2 eV; see (2005Kr03,2010Ot02,2011As10,2013Dr11).

  5LI c  1988Mi03: Implanted {+9}C into a thick Si detector and measured the    
  5LI2c  total |b-delayed breakup energy; deduced |b-decay feeding to low-lying 
  5LI3c  states. They missed several higherlying states that are fed and did not
  5LI4c  directly distinguish delayed p vs. |a emission.                        
  5LI c  2000Ge09: {+9}C from the TRIUMF/TISOL facility was implanted in a thin 
  5LI2c  carbon foil. Data were taken in two detector configurations; one       
  5LI3c  configuration was sensitive to decay through the p+{+8}Be{-g.s.} decay 
  5LI4c  mode while the other configuration was sensitive to the                
  5LI5c  |a+{+5}Li{-g.s.} and p+{+8}Be*(3.0) decay channels. Breakup particles  
  5LI6c  from {+9}C ->{+8}Be+p -> 2|a+p and {+9}C ->{+5}Li+|a ->2|a+p were      
  5LI7c  detected either in an array of 4 |DE-E telescopes configured with two  
  5LI8c  segmented Si annular detectors or with a similar array 2 |DE-E         
  5LI9c  telescopes configured with two doublesided position sensitive Si strip 
  5LIac  detectors and a plastic scintillator to count |b-particles. Detector   
  5LIbc  sensitivities and coincidence efficiencies were evaluated by Monte     
  5LIcc  Carlo techniques, and a phenomenological approach was used to deduce   
  5LIdc  the |b-decay reaction branching ratios.                                
  5LI c  2001Be51: At the CERN/ISOLDE facility, doublesided strip detectors     
  5LI2c  (DSSD) were coupled with thick stopping detectors to provide           
  5LI3c  high-granularity and large solid angle coverage for detecting decay    
  5LI4c  particles. Emphasis was placed on characterizing population and decay  
  5LI5c  of the |?14.65 MeV IAS. Furthermore a thin |DE DSSD was implemented    
  5LI6c  to avoid threshold (efficiency) concerns that troubled (2000Ge09).     
  5LI7c  Lastly, the experimenters evaluated the decay branching ratios for the 
  5LI8c  {+12}B*(12.2) state. Little comment is given on other populated levels.
  5LI c  2001Bu05: The authors of (2000Ge09) give a more rigorous alternate     
  5LI2c  interpretation of their data in a full R-matrix analysis. There is a   
  5LI3c  poor agreement between deduced level energies and accepted energy      
  5LI4c  values.

  5LI c  Four relevant articles are given that discuss three different          
  5LI2c  experimental efforts. Agreement is relatively mixed.                   
  5LI c  The experiments that are most sensitive to decay to {+9}B{-g.s.} find  
  5LI2c  the largest feeding to that state, we take (54.1 {I15})% from          
  5LI3c  (2001Be51). Data from TRIUMF produced the most comprehensive set of    
  5LI4c  populated levels, though they are analyzed via two different methods in
  5LI5c  (2000Ge09) and (2001Bu05) yielding somewhat different results, due in  
  5LI6c  part to differences in the {+9}B{-g.s.} branch and subsequent          
  5LI7c  renormalization. Lastly are the states above 14 MeV, (2000Ge09) reports
  5LI8c  only {+9}B*(14.0: J|p= ?) which decays mainly via proton emission,     
  5LI9c  while (2001Be51) reports population of {+9}B*(14.6: J|p=3/2-) which    
  5LIac  decays about evenly via p and |a emission. On the other hand the       
  5LIbc  analysis of (2001Bu05) reports population of both levels. Finally, in  
  5LIcc  (2000Ge09, 2001Bu05) a previously unknown {+9}B level at E{-x}=13.3    
  5LIxc  MeV is reported.

  5LI4c  of the E{-x}=14.0 and 14.6 MeV states are accepted, though it may      
  5LI5c  be that only one level was populated. The particle breakup branching   
  5LI6c  ratios for {+9}B*(12.2) are accepted from (2001Be51). And lastly, the

  7LI2c  {+9}Be(t,p){+11}Be reaction by bombarding 50 |mg/cm{+2} targets with   
  7LI3c  3.0-MeV tritons. Ge(Li) and NaI(Tl) detectors and Si detectors were    
  7LI4c  used to measure |g-rays and |a-particles. Eight |g-ray transitions and 
  7LI5c  T{-1/2}=13.6 s {I6} were measured. In general, the decay intensities   
  7LI6c  to {+11}B levels are deduced by balancing the observed |g-ray          
  7LI7c  transitions and |g-decay branching ratios (BRs) with the observed rate 
  7LI8c  of |b-rays. The strongest {+11}B transition is the 2125-keV |g ray from
  7LI9c  the first excited state to the ground state, which is directly fed and 
  7LIac  fed from higher-lying states.                                          
  7LI c  The delayed |a-particle spectrum was also measured. The interpretation 
  7LI2c  of this spectrum was complicated because the produced {+11}Be activity 
  7LI3c  was implanted into the target, and the observed energy                 
  7LI4c  depended on implantation depth, {+11}B parent level, emission angle    
  7LI5c  etc.. Analysis of the spectrum appeared most consistent with emission  
  7LI6c  from {+11}B*(9870). Two other potential |a-emitting states at          
  7LI7c  {+11}B*(10250,10380) were unfavored.                                   
  7LI c  The delayed |a Branching of 3.0% {I7} from {+11}B*(9870) to            
  7LI2c  {+7}Li{-g.s.} was deduced, based on an analysis that found an          
  7LI3c  intensity of 33% {I3} for the 2125-keV |g ray. Observed delayed        
  7LI4c  |a-particles were not found in coincidence with 478-keV |g-rays from   
  7LI5c  the first excited state of {+7}Li, but |a-particle emission to the     
  7LI6c  {+7}Li*(478) level could not be excluded because the relatively thick  
  7LI7c  targets could absorb the alphas before they reached the detector.      
  7LI8c  An upper limit of |< 5% feeding to the excited state was suggested.    
  7LI c  1981Al03: {+11}Be |b-delayed particle decays were measured using the   
  7LI2c  {+9}Be(t,p){+11}Be at E{-t}=3.4 MeV. The study was focused on          
  7LI3c  measuring the |b-delayed |a-particle branch. Thin {+9}Be foils         
  7LI4c  contained in a Helium-jet system permitted the capture of produced     
  7LI5c  activity in the He cell; the activity was then deposited on a counting 
  7LI6c  tape. The activity was transported to a counting area where Si and     
  7LI7c  NaI(Tl) detectors were used to measure delayed particles and |g-rays.  
  7LI c  |a particles and corresponding {+7}Li recoils ions were observed       
  7LI2c  both in singles and in coincidence with 478 keV |g-rays.               
  7LI3c  The |a-particle energy spectrum was unambiguously assigned to decay    
  7LI4c  from  {+11}B*(9870). The charged-particle spectrum observed            
  7LI5c  in coincidence with E{-|g}=485 keV {I10} provided evidence that some   
  7LI6c  small branching takes place from {+11}B*(9875) to the first            
  7LI7c  excited {+7}Li*(478) state; the Branching for this decay is 12.6%      
  7LI8c  {I12}. It is then concluded that the Branching of {+11}B*(9875) to     
  7LI9c  {+7}Li{-g.s.} is 87.4% {I12}. Compared with the well known E{-|g}=2125 
  7LIac  keV intensity (I=0.33 {I3}) and various cascades observed in the       
  7LIbc  {+11}Be(|b{+-}) decay scheme, the Branching of 2.9% {I4} to            
  7LIxc  {+11}B*(9875) was deduced.                                             
  7LI c  1982Mi08: {+11}Be |b-decay |g-ray activities were studied in the       
  7LI2c  {+9}Be(t,p){+11}Be reaction by bombarding a {+9}Be foil with 3.0-MeV   
  7LI3c  tritons. Ge(Li) and NaI(Tl) detectors and Pilot-B scintillation crystal
  7LI4c  were used to measure singles |g-ray, |g-|g coincidence and |b spectra  
  7LI5c  and |b-|g coincidences, respectively.                                  
  7LI c  The intensity of 2125-keV |g-decay of 0.370 {I25} was deduced.         
  7LI2c  Authors adopted the value of 0.355 {I18}, which is the average         
  7LI3c  of their value and the previous value of 0.33 {I3} (1971Al07).         
  7LI c  Comments: By normalizing the I{-|a}/I{-2125|g} of (1981Al03) to the    
  7LI2c  2125-keV |g-decay intensity=0.355 {I18} from (1982Mi08) a more precise 
  7LI3c  value of the |b-delayed |a-decay intensity, I{-|a}=0.031 {I4}, was     
  7LI4c  obtained. In (1981Al02) {+11}B*(9875) was found to decay with          
  7LI5c  Branching of 87.4% {I12} and 12.6% {I12} to {+7}Li*(0,478),

  8BE c  1988Mi03: Implanted {+9}C into a thick Si detector and measured the    
  8BE2c  total |b-delayed breakup energy; deduced |b-decay feeding to low-lying 
  8BE3c  states. They missed several higherlying states that are fed and did not
  8BE4c  directly distinguish delayed p vs. |a emission.                        
  8BE c  2000Ge09: {+9}C from the TRIUMF/TISOL facility was implanted in a thin 
  8BE2c  carbon foil. Data were taken in two detector configurations; one       
  8BE3c  configuration was sensitive to decay through the p+{+8}Be{-g.s.} decay 
  8BE4c  mode while the other configuration was sensitive to the                
  8BE5c  |a+{+5}Li{-g.s.} and p+{+8}Be*(3.0) decay channels. Breakup particles  
  8BE6c  from {+9}C ->{+8}Be+p -> 2|a+p and {+9}C ->{+5}Li+|a ->2|a+p were      
  8BE7c  detected either in an array of 4 |DE-E telescopes configured with two  
  8BE8c  segmented Si annular detectors or with a similar array 2 |DE-E         
  8BE9c  telescopes configured with two doublesided position sensitive Si strip 
  8BEac  detectors and a plastic scintillator to count |b-particles. Detector   
  8BEbc  sensitivities and coincidence efficiencies were evaluated by Monte     
  8BEcc  Carlo techniques, and a phenomenological approach was used to deduce   
  8BEdc  the |b-decay reaction branching ratios.                                
  8BE c  2001Be51: At the CERN/ISOLDE facility, doublesided strip detectors     
  8BE2c  (DSSD) were coupled with thick stopping detectors to provide           
  8BE3c  high-granularity and large solid angle coverage for detecting decay    
  8BE4c  particles. Emphasis was placed on characterizing population and decay  
  8BE5c  of the |?14.65 MeV IAS. Furthermore a thin |DE DSSD was implemented    
  8BE6c  to avoid threshold (efficiency) concerns that troubled (2000Ge09).     
  8BE7c  Lastly, the experimenters evaluated the decay branching ratios for the 
  8BE8c  {+12}B*(12.2) state. Little comment is given on other populated levels.
  8BE c  2001Bu05: The authors of (2000Ge09) give a more rigorous alternate     
  8BE2c  interpretation of their data in a full R-matrix analysis. There is a   
  8BE3c  poor agreement between deduced level energies and accepted energy      
  8BE4c  values.                                                                
  8BE c                                                                         
  8BE c  Comments:                                                              
  8BE c  Four relevant articles are given that discuss three different          
  8BE2c  experimental efforts. Agreement is relatively mixed.                   
  8BE c  The experiments that are most sensitive to decay to {+9}B{-g.s.} find  
  8BE2c  the largest feeding to that state, we take (54.1 {I15})% from          
  8BE3c  (2001Be51). Data from TRIUMF produced the most comprehensive set of    
  8BE4c  populated levels, though they are analyzed via two different methods in
  8BE5c  (2000Ge09) and (2001Bu05) yielding somewhat different results, due in  
  8BE6c  part to differences in the {+9}B{-g.s.} branch and subsequent          
  8BE7c  renormalization. Lastly are the states above 14 MeV, (2000Ge09) reports
  8BE8c  only {+9}B*(14.0: J|p= ?) which decays mainly via proton emission,     
  8BE9c  while (2001Be51) reports population of {+9}B*(14.6: J|p=3/2-) which    
  8BEac  decays about evenly via p and |a emission. On the other hand the       
  8BEbc  analysis of (2001Bu05) reports population of both levels. Finally, in  
  8BEcc  (2000Ge09, 2001Bu05) a previously unknown {+9}B level at E{-x}=13.3    
  8BExc  MeV is reported.                                                       
  8BE c  The {+9}B ground state feeding from (2001Be51) is accepted here; the   
  8BE2c  branching ratios from (2000Ge09) including the mostly |a background    
  8BE3c  component are then renormalized (|*' 0.864). The branches feeding both 
  8BE4c  of the E{-x}=14.0 and 14.6 MeV states are accepted, though it may      
  8BE5c  be that only one level was populated. The particle breakup branching   
  8BE6c  ratios for {+9}B*(12.2) are accepted from (2001Be51). And lastly, the  
  8BE7c  weak branch to {+9}B*(13.3) is included with some uncertainty.

 10LI c  2002Je11,2002Je14: A Ta-foil target was bombarded by a 1.4-GeV proton  
 10LI2c  beam to produce {+14}Be ions that were magnetically selected and were  
 10LI3c  stopped in a polypropylene foil. Two Si detectors were used to detect  
 10LI4c  |b decay products. |b-delayed charged particle emission is expected to 
 10LI5c  be a {+14}Be |b-decay mode, since it has been observed for neutron-rich
 10LI6c  He and Li isotopes. Shell-model calculations also place most of the |b 
 10LI7c  strength within a few MeV below the Q{-|b} value in a region that is   
 10LI8c  paticle unbound.                                                       
 10LI c  The authors calibrated the apparatus using two strong groups of        
 10LI2c  |a particles emitted in {+20}Na |b-decay. An upper limit on |b-delayed 
 10LI3c  |a particles of < 1.2 x 10{+-4} was observed along with weak evidence  
 10LI4c  for |b-delayed tritons at intensity of 6 x 10{+-5} < B(|bt) < 4 x      
 10LI5c  10{+-4} (at 95% confidence level). These tiny experimental intensities 
 10LI6c  disagree with the shell-model calculations. Part of this discrepancy   
 10LI7c  might be due to the poor knowledge on the possible |b-delayed          
 10LI8c  multi-neutron branches.

 10BE c  2014Ri01: The authors searched for {+11}Be(|b{+-}p) decay by implanting
 10BE2c  a highly pure {+11}Be beam in a Cu beam stop and searching for {+10}Be 
 10BE3c  nuclides amongst the decay products.                                   
 10BE c  The {+11}Be ion beam was produced via proton spallation on a UC target 
 10BE2c  at the CERN/ISOLDE facility. The products were selected by element in  
 10BE3c  the laser ion source and mass selected in the ISOLDE separator before  
 10BE4c  implantation at 60 keV in a copper plate. The beryllium beam was       
 10BE5c  purified to an intensity of I({+10}Be) < 2 x 10{+-6} relative to       
 10BE6c  {+11}Be. The potential for {+11}Li contamination, which |b{+-}n decays 
 10BE7c  to {+10}Be with a branching ratio = (86.3 {I9})%, is eliminated by     
 10BE8c  using element separation at the laser ion source.                      
 10BE c  Three samples were collected with the mass separator tuned for {+11}Be,
 10BE2c  {+11}Li and {+10}Be beams, respectively. Atomic Mass Spectroscopy was  
 10BE3c  used to determine the {+10}Be content of the implanted samples along   
 10BE4c  with a "blank" sample. The analysis of the "blank" sample verified no  
 10BE5c  systematically high abundance of {+10}Be was present in the copper     
 10BE6c  plates, while analysis of the {+10}Be sample verified the method could 
 10BE7c  appropriately determine the {+10}Be abundance. Analysis of the sample  
 10BE8c  collected at the {+11}Li mass setting verified a negligible component  
 10BE9c  of {+11}Li in the beam. Finally, the {+11}Be sample indicated a        
 10BEac  |b{+-}p decay branching of (8.3 {I9}) x 10{+-6} by comparing the       
 10BEbc  measured {+10}Be composition with the number of {+11}Be ions initially 
 10BEcc  implanted in the copper plate.                                         
 10BE c  This branching ratio of {+11}Be(|b{+-}p) is consistent with a          
 10BE2c  preliminary experiment reported in 2013Bo06. The branching ratio is    
 10BE3c  unexpectedly high and is interpreted as quasi-free decay of the        
 10BE4c  {+11}Be halo neutron into a single-proton state.

 11B  c  1978Al10: Activity produced in the {+10}Be(t,p) reaction was measured  
 11B 2c  with a plastic scintillation detector to measure |b-rays. The          
 11B 3c  tritium beam was pulsed with a mechanical chopper (20 ms activation/400
 11B 4c  ms counting), and counting was carried out using a 5 cm thick          
 11B 5c  NE102 plastic scintillator detector. Using the least squares analysis, 
 11B 6c  half-life T{-1/2}=24.4 ms {I30} was obtained, but note the analysis    
 11B 7c  involved taking into account the activity from other radionuclides     
 11B 8c  produced in {+10}|b{++}t reactions ({+8}Li, {+9}Li, {+12}Be).          
 11B  c  An attempt was made to observe delayed neutrons using a moderated      
 11B 2c  {+3}He neutron counter; an upper limit of P{-n} |< 1% was obtained that
 11B 3c  depended on the {+9}Li delayed-neutron branching ratio. At the time the
 11B 4c  P{-n} of {+9}Li was taken as 35% (1974Aj01), but this value has been   
 11B 5c  revised to 50.8% so the limit of (1978Al10) should be adjusted         
 11B 6c  proportionally.                                                        
 11B  c  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
 11B 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 11B 3c  filter and transferes to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The           
 11B 4c  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
 11B 5c  nuclides. The ions were implanted in a Si detector and identified      
 11B 6c  by standard techniques. The beta-delayed neutrons were detected in a   
 11B 7c  polyethylene moderated {+3}He counter; half-lives and beta-delayed     
 11B 8c  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
 11B 9c  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of beta-delayed neutrons  
 11B ac  detected in the zero-threshold counter. This experiment has clear      
 11B bc  evidence of neutron emission with a P{-n} of 0.9% {I4} which is        
 11B cc  consistent with the published upper limit (1978Al10) and is more       
 11B dc  precise with the benefit of mass separtion. In addition, the half-life 
 11B ec  T{-1/2}=45 ms {I29} was measured.                                      
 11B  c  A subsequent conference report with the same author indicates the      
 11B 2c  |b-delayed neutron probability P{-n}=0.52% {I9} and T{-1/2}=21.32 ms   
 11B 3c  {I6} (the International conference on nuclear data for science and     
 11B 4c  technology: nuclear data for the twenty-first century, Gatlinburg, TN  
 11B 5c  (United States), 9-13 May 1994) .                                      
 11B  c  1994Ke06: A beam of {+12}Be was produced by bombarding a Be target with
 11B 2c  63 MeV/A {+18}O ions from the GANIL cyclotrons. The {+12}Be ions were  
 11B 3c  identified as they were implanted in a plastic scintillator that       
 11B 4c  was surrounded by a plastic scintillator beta counter.  A HPGe detector
 11B 5c  measured gamma-rays from the decay, and the beta-gamma coincident      
 11B 6c  events were analyzed during a 250 ms beam-off period. T{-1/2}=26.2 ms  
 11B 7c  {I24} was deduced. No clear evidence was found for de-excitation of    
 11B 8c  levels in {+11}B, and upper limits on the decay intensity to           
 11B 9c  {+12}B*(2621,2723) states were estimated as 0.008% {I6} and 0.040%     
 11B ac  {I26}, respectively. Hence, no detailed decay scheme has been          
 11B bc  experimentally confirmed.                                              
 11B  c  1999Be53: An uranium carbide target was bombarded by a 1-GeV proton    
 11B 2c  beam to produce a {+12}Be beam that was implanted in a kapton foil     
 11B 3c  located at the center of a {+3}He cylindrical neutron counter array.   
 11B 4c  The |b-particles from {+12}Be decay were detected by a plastic         
 11B 5c  scintillator located directly behind the implantation foil. The        
 11B 6c  P{-n} value was determined from the rate of neutrons detected in the   
 11B 7c  {+3}He counter. The measurement is relative to the "known" P{-n} value 
 11B 8c  of {+9}Li=50.0% {I18} (1991Re02). The value P{-n}=0.50 % {I3} was      
 11B ac  obtained; an additional proceedings result of P{-n}=0.48% {I+12}{I-10} 
 11B bc  (U. Koster et al., AIP Conf. Proc. 455 (1998) p. 989) is mentioned in  
 11B cc  the text.                                                              
 11B  c  2002Be53: A layered Ta target with improved Be release time            
 11B 2c  (vs 1999Be53) was used to improve the {+12}Be |b-decay life-time       
 11B 3c  studies. As in (1999Be53), protons from the CERN/ISOLDE facility       
 11B 4c  bombarded the spallation target to produce {+12}Be. The measured time  
 11B 5c  distributions of |b particles and delayed neutrons gave a weighted mean
 11B 6c  and improved value of T{-1/2}=21.49 ms {I3}. See also 2001Be53         
 11B 7c  T{-1/2}=21.50 ms {I4}, which is based on the same data.                
 11B  c  Comments: The value P{-n}=0.50 % {I3} (1999Be53) appears to be the most
 11B 2c  reliable value found in the literature. It is in agreement with        
 11B 3c  P{-n}=0.52% {I9} from the LANL work, but clearer experimental          
 11B 4c  details are given in the discussion. The lifetime analysis is a bit    
 11B 5c  more complicated. The values given in (1991Re02 and associated works)  
 11B 6c  are comparible with the weighted average of values in                  
 11B 7c  (1978Al10, 1984Du15, 1986Cu01, 1994Ke06, 2002Be53), however there is   
 11B 8c  little information available explaining the sometimes significant      
 11B 9c  variation in values given in (1991Re02) and those in the later         
 11B ac  works that used significantly overlapping data sets.

 12C  c  1969j021: A beam of 3 MeV tritons impinged on a thick {+11}B target    
 12C 2c  producing {+13}B nuclei via the {+11}B(t,p) reaction. The target was   
 12C 3c  irradiated for 3 ms, while counting lasted for 12 ms. The target was   
 12C 4c  surrounded by a 3 inch by 2 inch |b counter scintillator, a            
 12C 5c  1 inch thick by 8 inch diameter NE102 neutron detector and a           
 12C 6c  5 inch by 5 inch NaI |g-ray detector. Neutron energies were            
 12C 7c  determined by time-of-flight between the |b and neutron detectors.     
 12C 8c  Population of relatively strong neutron branches from {+13}C(7.5,8.86  
 12C 9c  MeV) were observed. Significantly stronger branches to {+13}C(0,3.68   
 12C Ac  MeV) were deduced from the |b- and |b-|g spectra                       
 12C Bc  (92.1% and 7.6%, respectively).                                        
 12C  c  1974Al12: The experimental setup was similar to 1969Jo21, except a     
 12C 2c  longer neutron flight path was used and higher statistics were         
 12C 3c  obtained. Weaker branches from {+13}C(8.86,9.90 MeV) were observed, and
 12C 4c  an upper limit on decay from {+13}C(9.50 MeV) was established.

 12C  c  2005Kn02: The {+13}O ions were produced at the IGISOL facility via     
 12C 2c  the {+12}N(p,2n) reaction                                              
 12C 3c  by impinging an E(p)|?45 MeV beam on a 1 mg/cm{+2} target. The {+13}O  
 12C 4c  ions recoiled out of the target and were collected in a helium carrier 
 12C 5c  gas which delivered them to the mass separator. The ions were          
 12C 6c  implanted on a 30 |mg/cm{+2} carbon foil. The implantation             
 12C 7c  target was surrounded by three position sensitive |D' E-E              
 12C 8c  Si detector telescopes which triggered the data acquisition and the    
 12C 9c  ISOLDE Si ball.                                                        
 12C  c  The observed proton energy spectrum was analyzed using                 
 12C 2c  Breit-Wigner peak shapes, and the best fit parameters for decay        
 12C 3c  groups was deduced using MINUIT. The absolute intensity                
 12C 4c  for decay branches was not directly measured, hence the results        
 12C 5c  are normalized to a prior measurement of the strong 9.8% {I20}         
 12C 6c  {+13}N*(3502) decay to {+12}C{-g.s.} (1990As01).                       
 12C  c  The 2005Kn02 data set has the highest statistics and covers a broader  
 12C 2c  energy range, when compared to the prior measurements                  
 12C 3c  (1965Mc09,1970Es03,1990As01); furthermore the discussion on the        
 12C 4c  line shape analysis suggests the results of 2005Kn02 should Be         
 12C 5c  adopted. Noteworthy differences between other measurements are         
 12C 6c  for decay from {+13}N*(8918), 2005Kn03 observe a stronger              
 12C 7c  p{-1} branch than earlier measurements. Second, no evidence is seen    
 12C 8c  for decay of {+13}N*(10360); the difference is attributed to the more  
 12C 9c  sophisticated lineshape analysis.                                      
 12C  c  A subtle note to understand the 2005Kn03 manuscript: in table          
 12C 2c  2 the {+13}N*(15065) % of all |b-decays value includes unobserved      
 12C 3c  contributions from |g decay, proton decay and |a decay.

 13B 7c  decay period, gated on nuclear species, provided the lifetime          
 13B 8c  measurement. T{-1/2}=4.2 ms {I7} was measured.                         
 13B  c  1988Du09: {+14}Be was produced by fragmentation of a 60 MeV/n {+22}Ne  
 13B 2c  beam impinging on either a tantalum or a carbon target and was selected
 13B 3c  using the LISE spectrometer. The |b-particles were                     
 13B 4c  detected by a plastic scintillator while the delayed neutrons          
 13B 5c  were detected through the Gd(n,|g) reaction. T{-1/2}=4.35 ms           
 13B 6c  {I17}, P{-0n}=0.14 {I3}, P{-1n}=0.81 {I4} and P{-2n}=0.05 {I2} were    
 13B 7c  measured.                                                              
 13B  c  1995Be25: {+14}Be ions were produced by fragmenting an 80 MeV/A        
 13B 2c  {+18}O beam on a Be target and filtering in the A1200 separator. The   
 13B 3c  beam was implanted in a thick BC412 scintillator during a 10.3 ms      
 13B 4c  accumulation period, followed by either a 10.3 ms or 40 ms beam-off    
 13B 5c  counting period. Beta particles from the decay were detected by        
 13B 6c  the implantation detector, while delayed neutrons were detected        
 13B 7c  using an array of 15 curved scintillator bars that were placed 1 meter 
 13B 8c  from the implantation detector. Neutron energies were deduced from the 
 13B 9c  time-of-flight (tof) between the |b-detector and the neutron array.    
 13B ac  In addition a HPGe detector was placed 83 mm from the implantation     
 13B bc  target.                                                                
 13B  c  Analysis of the data indicated 3-4% contamination from {+11}Li, a      
 13B 2c  correction was possible since the {+11}Li decay had been studied in    
 13B 3c  the same configuration. A neutron detector threshold of                
 13B 4c  0.77 MeV was unfortunately used in the measurements, which led to a    
 13B 5c  significantly low number of |b-n events. The data showed evdence for   
 13B 6c  delayed neutron groups at E{-n}= 3.02 MeV {I3} and 3.52 MeV {I7} with  
 13B 7c  intensities of 0.11% {I2}(stat) {I4}(sys) and 0.30% {I3}(stat)         
 13B 8c  {I5}(sys); the peaks from these weak branches lay ontop of a broad     
 13B 9c  peak that is likely associated with 2n and 3n decay. The multi-neutron 
 13B ac  branching ratio associated with the broad peak is 5% {I1}(stat)        
 13B bc  {I2}(sys). Furthermore, it is plausible that, for example, the         
 13B cc  E{-n}=3.52 MeV neutron group may correspond to sequantial 2n decay.    
 13B  c  Data from the HPGe detector indicated small participation from two     
 13B 2c  known transitions in {+13}B with E{-|g}=3528 keV {I1} and 3680 keV     
 13B 3c  {I1}, however low statistics prevented analysis of the neutron groups  
 13B 4c  that feed these transitions. No 740 keV |g-ray was observed for        
 13B 5c  the transition between the first excited state and ground state.       
 13B  c  A critical issue in the data collection is the relatively low rate of  
 13B 2c  delayed neutron emission. While more than 85% of the decays were       
 13B 3c  expected to be accompanied with neutrons, only about 7% of that        
 13B 4c  intensity is presently observed. It is then suggested that a state     
 13B 5c  in {+14}B, neutron unbound by < 800 keV, is strongly populated.        
 13B 6c  Lifetimes were deduced by two techniques, though high backgrounds      
 13B 7c  significantly complicated the determinations; 4.8 ms {I2}(stat)        
 13B 8c  {I4}(sys) was deduced from the raw decay curve while 4.0 ms {I12} was  
 13B 9c  deduced from the |b-n coincidence data.                                
 13B  c  1997Be66: The authors of 1995Be25 carried out a new measurement        
 13B 2c  at RIKEN, aimed at identifying the low-energy neutron group that       
 13B 3c  participates in the decay. A {+14}Be beam was produced by fragmenting  
 13B 4c  a 100 MeV/A {+18}O beam on a Be target; the beam was implanted in the  
 13B 5c  center of a Si detector telescope comprised of 5 detectors. The        
 13B 6c  telescope was sandwiched between two sets of plastic scintillators     
 13B 7c  that detected beta particles. Neutrons were detected in an array of    
 13B 8c  BC408 scintillator walls that were positioned |? 200 cm from the       
 13B 9c  implantation detector. In addition a HPGe detector was positioned      
 13B ac  131 mm from the implantation detector.                                 
 13B  c  Analysis of the decay curve indicates T{-1/2}=4.29 ms {I18}. Attention 
 13B 2c  was focused on the neutron energy region below E{-n}=800 keV, where    
 13B 3c  a sharp peak with E{-n}=287 keV {I3} and width=60 keV {I5} is observed.
 13B 4c  The peak falls at the edge of the neutron detectors' thresholds        
 13B 5c  and hence yields significant uncertainty in the branching ratio;       
 13B 6c  I(n:287)=39 to 100%. No |g-rays are observed in coincidence with       
 13B 7c  the neutron group, strongly (but inconclusively) suggesting decay      
 13B 8c  to {+13}B ground state. Decay to {+13}B{-g.s.} would imply decay from  
 13B 9c  a {+14}B*(1.28 MeV {I2}). The 740 keV |g-ray is not found in the       
 13B ac  spectrum, and no comment is given on the 3528 and 3680 keV gamma       
 13B bc  rays.                                                                  
 13B  c  1999Be53, 2002Be53: An uranium carbide target was bombarded by a 1-GeV 
 13B 2c  proton beam to produce a {+14}Be beam that was implanted in a kapton   
 13B 3c  foil located at the center of a moderated {+3}He cylindrical           
 13B 4c  neutron counter array.                                                 
 13B 5c  The |b-particles from {+14}Be decay were detected by a plastic         
 13B 6c  scintillator located directly behind the implantation foil. The        
 13B 7c  P{-n} value was determined from the rate of neutrons detected in the   
 13B 8c  {+3}He counter. The total neutron-emission probability P{-n}=101%      
 13B 9c  {I4} was measured along with an upper limit of P{-2n}+3P{-3n}          
 13B ac  < 2.4% (95% confidence limit). Combining P{-n} with the P{-2n}+3P{-3n} 
 13B bc  limit P{-1n} |? 100%(> 96%), P{-0n} < 4%, and P{-2n}+3P{-3n}=0.8% {I8} 
 13B cc  were deduced.                                                          
 13B  c  1997Ao01, 1997Ao04, 2002Ao03: A thick Be target was bombarded by a     
 13B 2c  100 MeV/A {+18}O beam to produce a {+14}Be beam that was selected by   
 13B 3c  the RIPS separator. The beam was implanted in a Si detector.           
 13B  c  The |b-rays were detected using a set of |DE-|DE-E plastic             
 13B 2c  scintillator detectors that were positioned above and below the        
 13B 3c  implantation detector, and a |DE-|DE coincidence requirement           
 13B 4c  was implemented to reduce background. Neutrons were detected either    
 13B 5c  in a low-energy array located 50 cm away from the stopper or           
 13B 6c  in a high-energy array located 1.5 m from the stopper. In addition a   
 13B 7c  HPGe clover detector was placed 149 mm from the target.                
 13B  c  T{-1/2}=4.84 ms {I10} was deduced by analyzing the                     
 13B 2c  the decay curve associated with the E{-n}=288-keV group; there is no   
 13B 3c  understanding of the discrepancy between this and prior values.        
 13B 4c  The neutron tof spectrum was dominated by E{-n}=288 keV {I1} peak,     
 13B 5c  I(n:288)=91% {I9}, that was not found in coincidence with any |g-ray.  
 13B 6c  The intensity of an additional neutron group at E{-n}=3.51 MeV {I6}    
 13B 7c  is found to be in agreement with the expectation from |b-delayed       
 13B 8c  neutron decay of the {+13}B daughter nucleus. The present analysis     
 13B 9c  was insensitive to the 3.02 MeV group reported by 1995Be25.            
 13B ac  The |g-ray spectrum indicated peaks at E{-|g}=3536 keV {I2} and 3685   
 13B bc  keV {I1}; the 3536 keV transition with I(|g)=0.9% {I3} is ascribed to  
 13B cc  a transition fed following delayed neutron decay to states in {+13}B,  
 13B ec  while the 3685 keV transition is fed in {+13}B decay to {+13}C states. 
 13B  c  Analysis of the data provides a measure on the 0n, 1n and 2n decay     
 13B 2c  branches. While the 740 keV transition between {+14}B first excited    
 13B 3c  state and {+14}B{-g.s.} is not observed, a limit on decay to either of 
 13B 4c  these states is found as I(0n) < 0.6% by searching for the 6.09 MeV    
 13B 5c  |g-ray that is fed in 81% of {+14}B decays to {+14}C. Similarly, the   
 13B 6c  intensity of the 3685 keV transition, which is fed by 7.6% of {+13}B   
 13B 7c  decays to {+13}C, implies I(1n)=94% {I5}. While no details on 2n decay 
 13B 8c  are observed, I(2n)=6% {I5} is deduced.                                
 13B  c  Comments:                                                              
 13B  c  With the exception of (1988Du09), all experiments find only upper      
 13B 2c  limits on the population of the bound levels in {+14}B*(0,740);        
 13B 3c  stringent limits of P(0n) < 4% (1999Be53) and < 0.6% (1997Ao04)        
 13B 4c  are determined. P(0n) < 0.6%, which is based on the search for         
 13B 5c  {+14}B decay radiations is accepted.                                   
 13B  c  Evidence for |b-delayed one neutron decay is significant. Analysis     
 13B 2c  of the {+13}B radiations implies I(1n)=94% {I5} (1997Ao04) while       
 13B 3c  data from a moderated {+3}He counter gives                             
 13B 4c  I(1n) > 96% (1999Be53).                                                
 13B 5c  The decay path is not fully understood for all the intensity.          
 13B 6c  (1997Ao04) assign 91% {I9} of the intensity to decay from              
 13B 7c  {+14}B*(1.28 MeV {I1}) to {+13}B{-g.s.}; no |g-rays are observed in    
 13B 8c  coincidence, so the |b-decay is here assumed to populate               
 13B 9c  {+14}B*(1.28 MeV) directly. Two additional decay radiations            
 13B ac  appear relevant to |b{+-}1n decay; first is the 3536 keV transition    
 13B bc  to {+13}B ground state observed by (1995Be25) and (1997Ao04),          
 13B cc  and second is the E{-n}=3.02 MeV group observed by (1995Be25).         
 13B dc  The intensity I(|g:3536)=0.9% {I3} was measured by (1997Ao04),         
 13B ec  though no neutron group was observed in a coincidence spectrum.        
 13B fc  Very weak population of an E{-n}=3.02 MeV group was observed           
 13B gc  by (1995Be25); while no |g-rays are observed in a coincidence,         
 13B hc  the neutron group cannot be definitively associated with decay to      
 13B ic  {+13}B{-g.s.}.                                                         
 13B  c  The 2n and 3n decay modes are not clearly identifiable,                
 13B 2c  most reported values are given as upper limits. Two relevant results   
 13B 3c  are given in (1997Ao04), where I(2n)=6% {I5} is deduced from           
 13B 4c  their I(0n) < 0.6% and I(1n)=94% {I6} values, and in                   
 13B 5c  (1999Be53) where analysis of the n-n and n-n-n                         
 13B 6c  correlations in their moderated {+3}He counter set the limit           
 13B 7c  P{-2n}+3P{-3n} < 0.8% {I8} (based on the 95% confidence                
 13B 8c  limit P{-2n}+3P{-3n} < 0.8% {I8}.                                      
 13B  c  Most of the lifetime measurements are consistent with                  
 13B 2c  values near 4.3 ms: T{-1/2}=4.2 ms {I7} (1986Cu01), 4.35 ms {I17}      
 13B 3c  (1988Du09), 4.8 ms {I2}(sta) {I4}(sys)                                 
 13B 4c  and 4.0 ms {I12} (1995Be25), 4.29 ms {I12} (1997Be66) and 4.84 ms {I10}
 13B 5c  (1997Ao07); however, the most precise value is the most discrepant.    
 13B 6c  The value  T{-1/2}=4.31 ms {I24} is accepted; this value               
 13B 7c  is the weighted value of measurements, excluding (1997Ao07),           
 13B 8c  with the uncertainty doubled.                                          
 13B  c  Further studies on the open charged particle decay channels have       
 13B 2c  found the |b{+-}|a intensity of I(|a) < 0.4% (2002Je14)                
 13B 3c  and the |b{+-}t intensity of I(t) = 0.02% {I1} (2002Je14); the parent  
 13B 4c  levels are not identified.

 13C 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 13C 3c  filter and transferred to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The          
 13C 4c  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
 13C 5c  nuclides. The neutrons were detected in a polyethylene moderated {+3}He
 13C 6c  counter, and standard techniques were implemented. The |b-delayed      
 13C 7c  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
 13C 8c  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons

 13C  c  1994Do08: A thick target was bombarded by 600 MeV protons to produce   
 13C 2c  {+17}N ions that were selected by the TISOL separator. The {+17}N      
 13C 3c  beam was implanted into a thin carbon-foil collector. Thin surface     
 13C 4c  barrier detector pairs counted the decay |a particles in coincidence   
 13C 5c  with {+13}C recoils.                                                   
 13C  c  T{-1/2}=3.92 s {I44} was observed which is in good agreement of 4.173  
 13C 2c  s {I4} (1993Ti07: weighted average of 1976Oh05: 4174 ms {I4}, 1972Al42:
 13C 3c  4169 ms {I8} and 1965Do13: 4160 ms {I31}). The |a spectrum was         
 13C 4c  reasonably fitted with a K-matrix parametrization using the            
 13C 5c  known resonances at {+17}O*(7.985 and 8.204 MeV). Although two         
 13C 6c  states are sufficient to fit the |a-spectrum, the possibility of decay 
 13C 7c  from the broad {+17}O*(7.56) state cannot be entirely discounted.      
 13C  c  A small contamination of {+18}N in the beam was used to make a         
 13C 2c  relative normalization of the {+17}N and {+18}N activities; then using 
 13C 3c  the lifetimes and {+18}N decay results from (1989Zh04), the            
 13C 4c  absolute |b|a branching of {+17}N was determined to be                 
 13C 5c  (2.5 {I4}) x 10{+-5}. The |b|a branching intensities to                
 13C 6c  {+17}O*(7.985, 8.204) were found to be (1.5 {I3}) x 10{+-5} and        
 13C 7c  (9.8 {I20}) x 10{+-6}, respectively. An upper limit of delayed |a decay
 13C 8c  intensity from {+17}O*(7.56), < 6.9 x 10{+-7}, is deduced; though the  
 13C ac  small |G{-|a}/|G=0.0002 for this state corresponds to a rather large I 
 13C bc  < 3.5% beta-decay intensity to this state that could be observed in    
 13C cc  other decay channels. Another possible level at {+17}O*(8.18) could    
 13C dc  influence the |b|a decay, but the best fit in this experiment showed a 
 13C ec  minimal and excludable effect.

 14B 5c  measured in the telescope the rf was scrambled until a decay           
 14B 6c  was measured in the telescope. Analysis of the implantation to         
 14B 7c  decay period, gated on nuclear species, provided the lifetime          
 14B 8c  measurement. T{-1/2}=4.2 ms {I7} was measured.                         
 14B  c  1988Du09: {+14}Be was produced by fragmentation of a 60 MeV/n {+22}Ne  
 14B 2c  beam impinging on either a tantalum or a carbon target and was selected
 14B 3c  using the LISE spectrometer. The |b-particles were                     
 14B 4c  detected by a plastic scintillator while the delayed neutrons          
 14B 5c  were detected through the Gd(n,|g) reaction. T{-1/2}=4.35 ms           
 14B 6c  {I17}, P{-0n}=0.14 {I3}, P{-1n}=0.81 {I4} and P{-2n}=0.05 {I2} were    
 14B 7c  measured.                                                              
 14B  c  1995Be25: {+14}Be ions were produced by fragmenting an 80 MeV/A        
 14B 2c  {+18}O beam on a Be target and filtering in the A1200 separator. The   
 14B 3c  beam was implanted in a thick BC412 scintillator during a 10.3 ms      
 14B 4c  accumulation period, followed by either a 10.3 ms or 40 ms beam-off    
 14B 5c  counting period. Beta particles from the decay were detected by        
 14B 6c  the implantation detector, while delayed neutrons were detected        
 14B 7c  using an array of 15 curved scintillator bars that were placed 1 meter 
 14B 8c  from the implantation detector. Neutron energies were deduced from the 
 14B 9c  time-of-flight (tof) between the |b-detector and the neutron array.    
 14B ac  In addition a HPGe detector was placed 83 mm from the implantation     
 14B bc  target.                                                                
 14B  c  Analysis of the data indicated 3-4% contamination from {+11}Li, a      
 14B 2c  correction was possible since the {+11}Li decay had been studied in    
 14B 3c  the same configuration. A neutron detector threshold of                
 14B 4c  0.77 MeV was unfortunately used in the measurements, which led to a    
 14B 5c  significantly low number of |b-n events. The data showed evdence for   
 14B 6c  delayed neutron groups at E{-n}= 3.02 MeV {I3} and 3.52 MeV {I7} with  
 14B 7c  intensities of 0.11% {I2}(stat) {I4}(sys) and 0.30% {I3}(stat)         
 14B 8c  {I5}(sys); the peaks from these weak branches lay ontop of a broad     
 14B 9c  peak that is likely associated with 2n and 3n decay. The multi-neutron 
 14B ac  branching ratio associated with the broad peak is 5% {I1}(stat)        
 14B bc  {I2}(sys). Furthermore, it is plausible that, for example, the         
 14B cc  E{-n}=3.52 MeV neutron group may correspond to sequantial 2n decay.    
 14B  c  Data from the HPGe detector indicated small participation from two     
 14B 2c  known transitions in {+13}B with E{-|g}=3528 keV {I1} and 3680 keV     
 14B 3c  {I1}, however low statistics prevented analysis of the neutron groups  
 14B 4c  that feed these transitions. No 740 keV |g-ray was observed for        
 14B 5c  the transition between the first excited state and ground state.       
 14B  c  A critical issue in the data collection is the relatively low rate of  
 14B 2c  delayed neutron emission. While more than 85% of the decays were       
 14B 3c  expected to be accompanied with neutrons, only about 7% of that        
 14B 4c  intensity is presently observed. It is then suggested that a state     
 14B 5c  in {+14}B, neutron unbound by < 800 keV, is strongly populated.        
 14B 6c  Lifetimes were deduced by two techniques, though high backgrounds      
 14B 7c  significantly complicated the determinations; 4.8 ms {I2}(stat)        
 14B 8c  {I4}(sys) was deduced from the raw decay curve while 4.0 ms {I12} was  
 14B 9c  deduced from the |b-n coincidence data.                                
 14B  c  1997Be66: The authors of (1995Be25) carried out a new measurement      
 14B 2c  at RIKEN, aimed at identifying the low-energy neutron group that       
 14B 3c  participates in the decay. A {+14}Be beam was produced by fragmenting  
 14B 4c  a 100 MeV/A {+18}O beam on a Be target; the beam was implanted in the  
 14B 5c  center of a Si detector telescope comprised of 5 detectors. The        
 14B 6c  telescope was sandwiched between two sets of plastic scintillators     
 14B 7c  that detected beta particles. Neutrons were detected in an array of    
 14B 8c  BC408 scintillator walls that were positioned |? 200 cm from the       
 14B 9c  implantation detector. In addition a HPGe detector was positioned      
 14B ac  131 mm from the implantation detector.                                 
 14B  c  Analysis of the decay curve indicates T{-1/2}=4.29 ms {I18}. Attention 
 14B 2c  was focused on the neutron energy region below E{-n}=800 keV, where    
 14B 3c  a sharp peak with E{-n}=287 keV {I3} and width=60 keV {I5} is observed.
 14B 4c  The peak falls at the edge of the neutron detectors' thresholds        
 14B 5c  and hence yields significant uncertainty in the branching ratio;       
 14B 6c  I(n:287)=39 to 100%. No |g-rays are observed in coincidence with       
 14B 7c  the neutron group, strongly (but inconclusively) suggesting decay      
 14B 8c  to {+13}B ground state. Decay to {+13}B{-g.s.} would imply decay from  
 14B 9c  a {+14}B*(1.28 MeV {I2}). The 740 keV |g-ray is not found in the       
 14B ac  spectrum, and no comment is given on the 3528 and 3680 keV gamma       
 14B bc  rays.                                                                  
 14B  c  1999Be53, 2002Be53: An uranium carbide target was bombarded by a 1-GeV 
 14B 2c  proton beam to produce a {+14}Be beam that was implanted in a kapton   
 14B 3c  foil located at the center of a moderated {+3}He cylindrical           
 14B 4c  neutron counter array.                                                 
 14B 5c  The |b-particles from {+14}Be decay were detected by a plastic         
 14B 6c  scintillator located directly behind the implantation foil. The        
 14B 7c  P{-n} value was determined from the rate of neutrons detected in the   
 14B 8c  {+3}He counter. The total neutron-emission probability P{-n}=101%      
 14B 9c  {I4} was measured along with an upper limit of P{-2n}+3P{-3n}          
 14B ac  < 2.4% (95% confidence limit). Combining P{-n} with the P{-2n}+3P{-3n} 
 14B bc  limit P{-1n} |? 100%(> 96%), P{-0n} < 4%, and P{-2n}+3P{-3n}=0.8% {I8} 
 14B cc  were deduced.                                                          
 14B  c  1997Ao01, 1997Ao04, 2002Ao03: A thick Be target was bombarded by a     
 14B 2c  100 MeV/A {+18}O beam to produce a {+14}Be beam that was selected by   
 14B 3c  the RIPS separator. The beam was implanted in a Si detector.           
 14B  c  The |b-rays were detected using a set of |DE-|DE-E plastic             
 14B 2c  scintillator detectors that were positioned above and below the        
 14B 3c  implantation detector, and a |DE-|DE coincidence requirement           
 14B 4c  was implemented to reduce background. Neutrons were detected either    
 14B 5c  in a low-energy array located 50 cm away from the stopper or           
 14B 6c  in a high-energy array located 1.5 m from the stopper. In addition a   
 14B 7c  HPGe clover detector was placed 149 mm from the target.                
 14B  c  T{-1/2}=4.84 ms {I10} was deduced by analyzing the                     
 14B 2c  the decay curve associated with the E{-n}=288-keV group; there is no   
 14B 3c  understanding of the discrepancy between this and prior values.        
 14B 4c  The neutron tof spectrum was dominated by E{-n}=288 keV {I1} peak,     
 14B 5c  I(n:288)=91% {I9}, that was not found in coincidence with any |g-ray.  
 14B 6c  The intensity of an additional neutron group at E{-n}=3.51 MeV {I6}    
 14B 7c  is found to be in agreement with the expectation from |b-delayed       
 14B 8c  neutron decay of the {+13}B daughter nucleus. The present analysis     
 14B 9c  was insensitive to the 3.02 MeV group reported by 1995Be25.            
 14B ac  The |g-ray spectrum indicated peaks at E{-|g}=3536 keV {I2} and 3685   
 14B bc  keV {I1}; the 3536 keV transition with I(|g)=0.9% {I3} is ascribed to  
 14B cc  a transition fed following delayed neutron decay to states in {+13}B,  
 14B ec  while the 3685 keV transition is fed in {+13}B decay to {+13}C states. 
 14B  c  Analysis of the data provides a measure on the 0n, 1n and 2n decay     
 14B 2c  branches. While the 740 keV transition between {+14}B first excited    
 14B 3c  state and {+14}B{-g.s.} is not observed, a limit on decay to either of 
 14B 4c  these states is found as I(0n) < 0.6% by searching for the 6.09 MeV    
 14B 5c  |g-ray that is fed in 81% of {+14}B decays to {+14}C. Similarly, the   
 14B 6c  intensity of the 3685 keV transition, which is fed by 7.6% of {+13}B   
 14B 7c  decays to {+13}C, implies I(1n)=94% {I5}. While no details on 2n decay 
 14B 8c  are observed, I(2n)=6% {I5} is deduced.                                
 14B  c  Comments:                                                              
 14B  c  With the exception of (1988Du09), all experiments find only upper      
 14B 2c  limits on the population of the bound levels in {+14}B*(0,740);        
 14B 3c  stringent limits of P(0n) < 4% (1999Be53) and < 0.6% (1997Ao04)        
 14B 4c  are determined. P(0n) < 0.6%, which is based on the search for         
 14B 5c  {+14}B decay radiations is accepted.                                   
 14B  c  Evidence for |b-delayed one neutron decay is significant. Analysis     
 14B 2c  of the {+13}B radiations implies I(1n)=94% {I5} (1997Ao04) while       
 14B 3c  data from a moderated {+3}He counter gives                             
 14B 4c  I(1n) > 96% (1999Be53).                                                
 14B 5c  The decay path is not fully understood for all the intensity.          
 14B 6c  (1997Ao04) assign 91% {I9} of the intensity to decay from              
 14B 7c  {+14}B*(1.28 MeV {I1}) to {+13}B{-g.s.}; no |g-rays are observed in    
 14B 8c  coincidence, so the |b-decay is here assumed to populate               
 14B 9c  {+14}B*(1.28 MeV) directly. Two additional decay radiations            
 14B ac  appear relevant to |b{+-}1n decay; first is the 3536 keV transition    
 14B bc  to {+13}B ground state observed by (1995Be25) and (1997Ao04),          
 14B cc  and second is the E{-n}=3.02 MeV group observed by (1995Be25).         
 14B dc  The intensity I(|g:3536)=0.9% {I3} was measured by (1997Ao04),         
 14B ec  though no neutron group was observed in a coincidence spectrum.        
 14B fc  Very weak population of an E{-n}=3.02 MeV group was observed           
 14B gc  by (1995Be25); while no |g-rays are observed in a coincidence,         
 14B hc  the neutron group cannot be definitively associated with decay to      
 14B ic  {+13}B{-g.s.}.                                                         
 14B  c  The 2n and 3n decay modes are not clearly identifiable,                
 14B 2c  most reported values are given as upper limits. Two relevant results   
 14B 3c  are given in (1997Ao04), where I(2n)=6% {I5} is deduced from           
 14B 4c  their I(0n) < 0.6% and I(1n)=94% {I6} values, and in                   
 14B 5c  (1999Be53) where analysis of the n-n and n-n-n                         
 14B 6c  correlations in their moderated {+3}He counter set the limit           
 14B 7c  P{-2n}+3P{-3n} < 0.8% {I8} (based on the 95% confidence                
 14B 8c  limit P{-2n}+3P{-3n} < 0.8% {I8}.                                      
 14B  c  Most of the lifetime measurements are consistent with                  
 14B 2c  values near 4.3 ms: T{-1/2}=4.2 ms {I7} (1986Cu01), 4.35 ms {I17}      
 14B 3c  (1988Du09), 4.8 ms {I2}(sta) {I4}(sys)                                 
 14B 4c  and 4.0 ms {I12} (1995Be25), 4.29 ms {I12} (1997Be66) and 4.84 ms {I10}
 14B 5c  (1997Ao07); however, the most precise value is the most discrepant.    
 14B 6c  The value  T{-1/2}=4.31 ms {I24} is accepted; this value               
 14B 7c  is the weighted value of measurements, excluding (1997Ao07),           
 14B 8c  with the uncertainty doubled.                                          
 14B  c  Further studies on the open charged particle decay channels have       
 14B 2c  found the |b{+-}|a intensity of I(|a) < 0.4% (2002Je14)                
 14B 3c  and the |b{+-}t intensity of I(t) = 0.02% {I1} (2002Je14); the parent  
 14B 4c  levels are not identified.

 14C  c  1974Al11: A target BeO (94% {+10}Be) was bombarded with 31-MeV {+6}Li  
 14C 2c  ions; a fast beam chopper was used to establish beam activation and    
 14C 3c  decay counting periods. A plastic scintillator detector measured the   
 14C 4c  beta emissions while a NaI(I(|g+ce)) detector measured coincident decay
 14C 5c  gamma-rays.                                                            
 14C  c  Activities from numerous reaction products were detected in the        
 14C 2c  target, however by applying a beta particle energy threshold cut to    
 14C 3c  the beta-gamma coincidence data it was possible to select {+14}C       
 14C 4c  gamma-rays that followed the decay of {+14}B.                          
 14C  c  The |b-decay is primarily to {+14}C*(6.09) [J|p=1-] and (6.73) [J|p=3-]
 14C 2c  states, though only an upper limit could be placed on a branch to the  
 14C 3c  (7.34) [J|p=2-] state. The half-life, T{-1/2}=16.1 ms {I12}, was       
 14C 4c  deduced by analyzing the decay curve of the {+14}C*(6.09) state for    
 14C 5c  events in coincidence with E{-|b} > 6.3 MeV.                           
 14C  c  The experimental results are gamma-ray intensities. The measured |g-ray
 14C 2c  intensity ratios are                                                   
 14C 3c  {II}{-6.09}/{II}{-6.73}/{II}{-7.34}=100/(10.0+-2.0)/< 2.2; using these 
 14C 4c  observed intensities and the level decay branching ratios from         
 14C 5c  1970Aj01, the relative beta feedings to the {+14}C*(6.09,6.73,7.34)    
 14C 6c  states was deduced.                                                    
 14C  c  In order to place the relative intensities on an absolute scale the    
 14C 2c  authors estimated the unobserved feeding to the ground state as        
 14C 3c  (5 {I3})%, and they made a further assumption that the %beta-n=0.      
 14C 4c  With these assumptions, which account for (5 {I3})% of the decay, the  
 14C 5c  beta decay branching ratios were deduced by combining the              
 14C 6c  measured |g-ray intensity ratios with the know level gamma-ray decay   
 14C 7c  branching ratios. The absolute beta-branching ratios                   
 14C 8c  I|b{-6.09}/I|b{-6.73}/I|b{-7.34}=(81 {I9})%/(8.6 {I+17-40})%/< 11% were
 14C 9c  deduced by normalizing to 100%. There are no new measurements on these 
 14C ac  relative values, however subsequent experiments have produced measured 
 14C bc  values for the beta feeding to the ground state and to neutron unbound 
 14C cc  states.                                                                
 14C  c  1993ReZX: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
 14C 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 14C 3c  filter and transferred to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The          
 14C 4c  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
 14C 5c  nuclides. The neutrons were detected in a polyethylene moderated {+3}He
 14C 6c  counter, and standard techniques were implemented. The |b-delayed      
 14C 7c  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
 14C 8c  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons    
 14C 9c  detected in the zero-threshold counter.

 14C 4c  telescope while gamma-rays were detected in a NaI detector. A          
 14C 5c  high-energy component with E{-|b} > 14.6 MeV was observed and found    
 14C 6c  in anti-coincidence with gamma-rays. This branch is attributed to

 14C 2c  Absolute beta branching ratios have been measured for feeding to       
 14C 3c  the {+14}C ground state and for feeding to neutron unbound states.     
 14C 4c  Therefore, the relative gamma-ray intensity values of (1974Al11)       
 14C 5c  are reevaluated with the current level gamma decay branching           
 14C 6c  ratios, and the deduced intensities are normalzed with the decay       
 14C 7c  feeding the {+14}C ground state and the %|b-n.                         
 14C  c  In the analysis of the uncertainties of the I|b branching ratios the   
 14C 2c  I|b{-7.34} is treated as I|b{-max}/2 {I+}- I|b{-max}/2, and the        
 14C 3c  uncertainty mainly impacts the I|b{-6.09} branch.

 14C  c  1991Ha25: A beam of {+15}B ions was produced by fragmenting a {+18}O   
 14C 2c  beam on a thick {+9}Be target. {+15}B beam was separated in the A1200  
 14C 3c  fragment separator and finally implanted in a BC412 detector at the    
 14C 4c  rate of |? 600 hz. Less than 6% contamination from {+9}Li, {+6}He and  
 14C 5c  {+3}H was present in the beam.                                         
 14C  c  Beam on/off cycles of 50 ms on/50 ms off and 20 ms on/40 ms off were   
 14C 2c  used to pulse the implantation so the delayed neutron decay could be   
 14C 3c  studied.                                                               
 14C  c  An array of 16 BC412 neutron detectors, curved bar shaped with a       
 14C 2c  radius of 1 m, covered roughly 1.9 sr and detected neutron energies by 
 14C 3c  tof between the implantation detector and the wall array.              
 14C  c  Decay half-lives of T{-1/2}=10.4 ms {I2} and 10.5 ms {I4} were         
 14C 2c  obtained for inclusive decays in the implantation detector and         
 14C 3c  exclusive decays that required a coincidence between the implantation  
 14C 4c  detector and the wall, respectively.                                   
 14C  c  Feeding to the neutron unbound excited states of {+15}C was deduced by 
 14C 2c  analyzing the tof spectrum between the implantation detector and the   
 14C 3c  neutron wall; five groups are observed. Analysis indicates the delayed 
 14C 4c  neutron decays proceed via {+15}C*(3.1, 4.22, 4.66, 5.83, 6.36 MeV) -> 
 14C 5c  {+14}C{-g.s.}+n.                                                       
 14C  c  Finally, a measurement with 5 s activation and 6 s counting was used   
 14C 2c  to measure {+15}B |b-decay to {+15}C*(0, 0.74), the ratio of implanted 
 14C 3c  {+15}B ions to the observed {+15}C decay activity yields the branching 
 14C 4c  ratio to populate these states, as well as, the 0 delayed neutron      
 14C 5c  emission probability, P{-0n}. The value %P{-0n}=0.32 {I8} is

 14C  c  1989Zh04: A thick Ta target was bombarded by a 35 MeV/A {+22}Ne beam   
 14C 2c  to produce {+18}N ions that were selected by the Reaction Products Mass
 14C 3c  Separator (RPMS). The {+18}N ions were implanted into a telescope      
 14C 4c  comprised of five Si detectors that was situated in the focal plane    
 14C 5c  of the RPMS. An implantation period of 1.2 s was used for collecting   
 14C 6c  activity; this was followed by a 1.3 s counting period. The |b-decay   
 14C 7c  products were detected with essentially 100% efficiency. The apparatus 
 14C 8c  was calibrated using |b-delayed |a-particle emissions groups from      
 14C 9c  {+11}Be and {+8}Li nuclei.                                             
 14C  c  Two strong groups are observed in the |a-particle spectrum, resulting  
 14C 2c  from decays of the {+18}O*(7616,8038) states with J|p=1{+-}{-3} and    
 14C 3c  1{+-}{-4}, respectively.  A broad peak near 3 MeV (E{-x}=9 MeV, |G{-|a}
 14C 4c  |? 500 keV) is also observed but the origin was unclear. 1987Aj02      
 14C 5c  suggests there may be 6 unresolved |a-particle emitting groups in this 
 14C 6c  region. The |b-decay branching ratios to {+18}O*(7616,8038) are found  
 14C 7c  as 6.8% {I5} and 1.8% {I2} assuming |G{-|a}/|G=1.0 for these states.   
 14C 8c  The branching ratio |> 3.6% {I2} was deduced for the broad structure.  
 14C 9c  A total |b-delayed |a-decay branching ratio of (12.2 {I6})% is deduced.
 14C  c  1993Bu21, 2007Bu01: A thick target was bombarded by a 500 MeV proton   
 14C 2c  beam to produce {+18}N ions that were selected by the TISOL separator. 
 14C 3c  The resulting {+18}N{+16}O molecular beam was implanted in a 10        
 14C 4c  |mg/cm{+2} carbon foil. After a 1.0 s collection time, the             
 14C 5c  catcher foil was rotated to a position between two Si surface barrier  
 14C 6c  detectors. About a hundred times the yield of 1989Zh04 was obtained.   
 14C 7c  T{-1/2}=620 ms {I8} was measured for the activity, which is consistent 
 14C 8c  with the {+18}N lifetime.                                              
 14C  c  The observed |a-spectrum was calibrated at the E{-|a}=1.081 and 1.409  
 14C 2c  MeV peaks (from {+18}O*(7616,8038)) and analyzed with the R-matrix     
 14C 3c  approach. The full range of the |a-particle spectrum was roughly double
 14C 4c  that of 1989Zh04 and additional |a-groups were observed at higher      
 14C 5c  energies. In the analysis the branching ratios are normalized          
 14C 7c  to 12.2% from 1989Zh04 (6.8% {I5}, 1.8% {I2} and 3.6% {I2}).

 14C  c  The work of 2007Bu01 resolves the |a-spectrum at E{-|a}=1.5-5.5 MeV    
 14C 2c  into seven states that show a distinct interference pattern. Treatment 
 14C 3c  in the E{-|a} |? 2.2 MeV region is different; 1989Zh04 assume a        
 14C 4c  multi-component group while 2007Bu01 assume a single broad state as    
 14C 5c  indicated by 1993Re03.                                                 
 14C  c  The R-matrix analysis of the superior data set in 2007Bu01 is          
 14C 2c  preferred, but the normalization of branching ratios in 2007Bu01 to    
 14C 3c  12.2% from 1989Zh04 is surprising, since 2007Bu01 observed many groups 
 14C 4c  that had not been observed in 1989Zh04. By chance both analyses have   
 14C 5c  deduced the same branching ratio for the strongest E{-|a}=1.081 MeV    
 14C 6c  group; this normalization is accepted and the analysis in 2007Bu01 is  
 14C 7c  adopted with the total |b-delayed |a-decay branching ratio of          
 14C 8c  (12.2 {I14})%.

 15N  c  Data on {+16}C |b-n decay to {+15}N are derived from 3 articles, each  
 15N 2c  providing improvement.                                                 
 15N  c  1976Al02: {+16}C nuclei were created using the                         
 15N 2c  {+14}C({+18}O,{+16}O){+16}C and {+11}B({+7}Li,2p) {+16}C reactions.    
 15N 3c  Delayed neutrons, from {+16}C decay in the target, were deteted in 1   
 15N 4c  {+3}He proportional counters. A paraffin moderator was used, along     
 15N 5c  with beam chopping, to measure T{-1/2}=747 ms {I8}. The bare {+3}He    
 15N 6c  counter was used to measure the delayed neutron energy spectrum; two   
 15N 7c  groups were observed with E{-n}=790 keV {I30} and E{-n}=1720 keV 50.   
 15N 8c  The ratio of intensities is I{-0.79}/I{-1.72}=5.4|+0.7. No evidence    
 15N xc  was found for delayed |g-rays.                                         
 15N  c  1983Ga03: The {+14}C(t,p){+16}C reaction produced {+16}C nuclei in the 
 15N 2c  target. Three planar HPGe detectors were configured to detect |g-rays, 
 15N 3c  a thin plastic scintillator counted |b-rays and a stilbene crystal     
 15N 4c  counted neutrons. The 120 keV |g-ray transition to the ground state is 
 15N 5c  observed, with I(120 keV)=(0.68 +9 -11)%, while limits of <0.1% are    
 15N 6c  placed on other transitions. Hence |b-1n|?(99.32 +11 -9)%.             
 15N  c  2001Gr06: A beam of {+16}C is produced by fragmentation reactions and  
 15N 2c  implanted in a NE102 scintillator block. The implantation detector     
 15N 3c  was surrounded by TONNERRE, a neutron array that covered 45% of 4|p,   
 15N 4c  and decay neutron were evaluated by their time-of-flight for the 1.2 m 
 15N 5c  transit. A branch corresponding to E{-n}=3.29 MeV was observed and     
 15N 6c  identified with a half life that correlates with {+16}C decay. The     
 15N 7c  {+3}He counter of 1976Al02 would have been insensitive to the          
 15N 8c  I=(1.0|+0.2)% branch for this decay path.                              
 15N  c  In summary, absolute intensities are deduced for {+16}C decay to       
 15N xc  neutron

 16C  c  1996Ra02: A beam of {+17}B ions was produced by fragmenting a {+22}Ne  
 16C 2c  beam on a {+9}Be target. The beam was magnetically separated, degraded 
 16C 3c  to lower energies, and finally stopped in a plastic scintillator.      
 16C 4c  The implantation detector was sandwiched between four other            
 16C 5c  scintillator                                                           
 16C 6c  detectors, and a valid event required a coincidence between three      
 16C 7c  ajacent detectors. Three neutron walls surrounded the implantation     
 16C 8c  target and covered about 1.4 sr. The decay neutron energy was          
 16C 9c  deduced by the time of flight between the implantation detector and    
 16C Ac  the neutron wall detectors. The ToF was calibrated by studying the     
 16C Bc  decay of {+17}N which has three visible known neutron groups.          
 16C  c  The measured neutron spectrum shows two prominent decay groups         
 16C 2c  from {+17}B |b delayed neutron decay at E{-n}=2.91 and 1.80 MeV, as    
 16C 3c  well as, a strong peak at E{-n}=0.82 MeV from the daughter {+16}N      
 16C 4c  decay. A full analysis of the neutron energy spectrum revealed two     
 16C 5c  neutron groups corresponding to known branches in {+16}N decay and     
 16C 6c  four groups that are attributed to {+17}B decay. The results are       
 16C 7c  presented by normalizing to %B-{+1}n=63% {I1} from (1988Du09).

 16N  c  1995Sc03: A beam of {+17}C ions was produced by fragmenting a {+22}Ne  
 16N 2c  beam on a {+9}Be target. The beam was magnetically separated, degraded 
 16N 3c  to lower energies, and finally stopped in a plastic implantaion        
 16N 4c  scintillator detector. The beam carried a<14% {+14}B impurity.         
 16N 5c  The data were collected with a 607 ms beam-on/ 583 ms beam-off cycle.  
 16N  c  Neutrons were detected in one of 15 plastic scintallator bars that     
 16N 2c  formed an array surrounding the target with a 99.7 cm flight path.     
 16N 3c  The neutron energies were determined by ToF                            
 16N 4c  between the implantation detector and the neutron array.               
 16N 5c  The ToF analysis permitted subtraction of background events from       
 16N 6c  {+14}B beam impurities and {+17}C decay daughters ({+17}N and {+16}N), 
 16N 7c  resulting in four neutron energy groups at E{-n}=1.62, 1.93, 2.82 and  
 16N 8c  3.73 MeV that are attributed to {+17}C decay. The two higher-energy    
 16N 9c  groups are quite broad and are attributed to unresolved decay doublets 
 16N Ac  at E{-n}=2.25 MeV {I2} and 2.91 MeV {I3}, and E{-n}=3.35 MeV {I3} and  
 16N Bc  3.86 MeV {I3}, respectively. The decay doublets are possibly           
 16N Cc  attributed to, for example, decay from a state in {+17}N to two        
 16N Dc  low-lying states in {+16}N. Note: the excitation energies suggested in 
 16N Ec  footnotes c and d for table 1 do not appear to correlate with the      
 16N xc  decay kinematics.

 16O 7c  assumption of %|b-n=100-(4.66 {I75}))=(95.34 {I75})% (feeding to       
 16O 8c  neutron bound states).                                                 
 16O  c  1964Si06: {+17}N activity was produced in thin-walled cells comprised  
 16O 2c  of either aluminium or stainless steel using the {+15}N(t,p)           
 16O 3c  reaction. A NaI detector observed the |g-ray spectrum obtained         
 16O 4c  in measurements on the stainless steel cell; transitions at E{-|g}=    
 16O 5c  870 and 2190 keV were observed with a relative ratio=(6.8 {I9}):1.0.   
 16O 6c  Since the 2190 transition corresponds to a cascade from {+17}O*(3055)  
 16O 7c  to {+17}O*(870), the relative feeding of the first and second excited  
 16O 8c  states is (5.8 {I9}):1.0 . Care was taken to minimize contributions    
 16O 9c  from n+p capture that could interfere with the E{-|g}=2190 keV         
 16O ac  analysis. No other |g-rays were observed; in particular transitions    
 16O bc  from {+17}O*(3843:J|p=5/2-) and transitions in {+16}O were not         
 16O cc  observed.                                                              
 16O  c  The measurements on the aluminium cell were analyzed to obtain the     
 16O 2c  singles |b-ray spectrum and the |b-ray plus |g-ray coincidence         
 16O 3c  spectrum. The part of the singles spectrum that extended above the     
 16O 4c  coincidence spectrum was analyzed to obtain the ratio of feeding to    
 16O 5c  {+17}O*(870) relative to feeding to the {+17}O{-g.s.}=(1.7 {I4}):1.0.  
 16O  c  Lastly, the beta spectrum was analyzed to determine the feeding |b-ray 
 16O 2c  intensity to {+17}O*(0,870,3055) relative to the total |b-ray          
 16O 3c  intensity. These decay branches correspond to (4.66 {I75})% of all     
 16O 4c  decays.                                                                
 16O  c  Hence the calculated branching fractions are                           
 16O 2c  (1.55 {I47})% to {+17}O{-g.s.},                                        
 16O 3c  (2.64 {I47})% to {+17}O*(870),                                         
 16O 4c  (0.46 {I11})% to {+17}O*(3055).                                        
 16O 5c  Furthermore, the lack of feeding to {+17}O*(3843:J|p=5/2-) is          
 16O 6c  evidence for assigning J|p=1/2- to {+17}N{-g.s.}.                      
 16O  c  1973De32: {+17}N ions were produced by bombarding 88% enriched {+14}C  
 16O 2c  target which was on a thick tungsten backing with 27-MeV |a-particles. 
 16O 3c  The neutrons were detected with a {+3}He filled proportional counter.  
 16O 4c  Three neutron groups at E{-n}=390 {I16}, 1190 {I30} and 1710 {I40} keV 
 16O 5c  emitted from {+17}O*(4.55,5.09,5.94 MeV) to {+16}O{-g.s.} with         
 16O 6c  branching ratios of 27% {I3}, 57% {I4} and 11% {I2}, respectively.     
 16O 7c  Relative neutron branching ratios are measured, which are normalized   
 16O 8c  to the accepted %|b-n rate of 95%. From the neutron counts in the      
 16O 9c  1.9-2.6 MeV region an upper limit, < 0.4%, is set for the branches     
 16O ac  emitted from {+17}O*(6.1-6.8) to {+16}O{-g.s.}.                        
 16O  c  1973Po11: {+17}N |b{+-}-decay activity was produced by bombarding      
 16O 2c  enriched {+15}N{-2} gas (95-99% {+15}N) using a 2.9-MeV triton beam.   
 16O 3c  The beam was chopped and had 4 second activation and counting periods. 
 16O 4c  The |b activity was detected by a NE102 detector, the |g-decay         
 16O 5c  activity was detected via a 15.2 cm by 12.7 cm NaI detector. The       
 16O 6c  neutron activity was initially measured using a NE102 disk, though     
 16O 7c  issues with high backgrounds at low-energies led to additional         
 16O 8c  measurements using a {+3}He proportional counter. The |b-n and |b-|g   
 16O 9c  coincidences were measured; there is no mention of n-|g coincidences,  
 16O ac  therefore neutron decays are assumed to populate {+16}O{-g.s.}.        
 16O  c  Neutron peaks at 385 {I4}, 1163 {I14} and 1675 {I24} keV were observed 
 16O 2c  corresponding to decays from {+17}O*(4.55,5.38,5.94) to {+16}O{-g.s.}, 
 16O 3c  respectively. The relative ratios for decay branches were determined,  
 16O 4c  and then the absolute branching ratios were determined by a            
 16O 5c  self-consistent renormalization. The feeding to the {+17}O{-g.s.}      
 16O 6c  relative to {+17}O*(870) was taken from (1964Si06) (=(1.7 {I4}):1.0);  
 16O 7c  other ratios, relative to the E{-n}=1.16 MeV group intensity, were     
 16O 8c  determined. The absolute branching ratios were determined as           
 16O 9c  Branching=(1.7 {I5})% to {+17}O{-g.s.}, (2.9 {I5})% to {+17}O*(870),   
 16O ac  (0.54 {I8})% to {+17}O*(3060), (37.9% {I18}) to {+17}O*(4550),         
 16O bc  (51.1% {I15}) to {+17}O*(5380), and (5.8% {I6}) to {+17}O*(5940). The  
 16O cc  total feeding to bound {+17}O levels was found to be (5.14 {I72})%.    
 16O  c  1976Al02: {+17}N ions were produced in the {+15}N(t,p) reaction by     
 16O 2c  bombarding a Ti{+15}N target with 3.0-MeV tritons. The target was      
 16O 3c  irradiated for 4 sec, followed by a 4 sec counting period.             
 16O  c  The |g-ray activity was measured using a Ge(Li) detector. Energies for 
 16O 2c  the {+17}O first and second excited states were determined as 870.8 keV
 16O 3c  {I2} and 3055.2 keV {I3}, and the ratio of the |g ray intensities was  
 16O 4c  measured as 1:(9.6 {I4}). This ratio is significanly different from    
 16O 5c  prior results and is attributed to the ability to resolve the          
 16O 6c  E{-|g}=2190 keV transition from the E{-|g}=2223 keV peak from thermal  
 16O 7c  neutron capture on hydrogen.  No attempt to measure the ground-state   
 16O 8c  branch was made, and hence the values for branching to {+17}O{-g.s.}   
 16O 9c  and {+17}O bound levels was taken from (1964Si06). The branching ratios
 16O ac  were found as (1.6 {I5})% to {+17}O{-g.s.}, (3.0 {I5})% to             
 16O bc  {+17}O*(870), (0.34 {I6})% to {+17}O*(3055).                           
 16O  c  Delayed neutrons were measured using a {+3}He neutron detector; peaks  
 16O 2c  at E{-n}=390, 1160 and 1690 keV were observed. Taking the sum of |b    
 16O 3c  branches to neutron-stable level in {+17}O as (4.9 {I7})%, the         
 16O 4c  branching ratios from {+17}O*(4.55,5.38,5.94 MeV) to {+16}O{-g.s.} are 
 16O 5c  found as 39.2% {I20}, 48.0% {I15} and 7.9% {I7}, respectively.         
 16O  c  1976Oh05: {+17}N |b-decay activity was produced via the                
 16O 2c  {+6}Li(n,|a){+3}H and {+18}O({+3}H,|a){+17}N reactions by              
 16O 3c  placing an enriched {+6}Li{-2}C{+18}O{-3} target (|> 95% {+6}Li, 93.4% 
 16O 4c  {+18}O) in a reactor and utilizing a fast pneumatic tube system to     
 16O 5c  transfer the sample between activation and counting stations. The      
 16O 6c  {+17}N neutron decay curve was measured with eight {+3}He proportional 
 16O 7c  counters surrounded by paraffin. Four peaks at E{-n}=382.8 {I9}, 884   
 16O 8c  {I21} (new identified), 1170.9 {I8} and 1700.3 {I17} keV were measured 
 16O 9c  with |G=54.8 {I4}, 113 {I55}, 63.2 {I11} and 60.5 {I32} keV,           
 16O ac  respectively. Normalization of the neutron emission probabilities to   
 16O bc  P{-n}=95% {I1} from (1964Si06), yields the |b{+-}n branching ratios    
 16O cc  from {+17}O*(4.55,5.08,5.39,5.95 MeV) to {+16}O{-g.s.} as, 34.8% {I26},
 16O dc  0.6% {I4}, 52.7% {I35} and 7.0% {I5}, respectively.                    
 16O  c  In addition, T{-1/2}=4.174 s {I4} was measured.                        
 16O  c  1984In01: The neutron spectrum of activated cooling water from the     
 16O 2c  SLAC beam dump was analyzed using a {+3}He spectrometer. The activity  
 16O 3c  is presumably from the {+18}O(|g,p){+17}N reaction. In addition to     
 16O 4c  strong neutron lines at E{-n}=383, 1170 and 1700 keV a significantly   
 16O 5c  weaker group at E{-n}=2070 keV is suggested. This group has not been   
 16O 6c  reported in other work.                                                
 16O  c  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
 16O 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 16O 3c  filter and transferred to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The          
 16O 4c  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
 16O 5c  nuclides. The neutrons were detected in a polyethylene moderate {+3}He 
 16O 6c  counter, and standard techniques were implemented. The |b-delayed      
 16O 7c  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
 16O 8c  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons    
 16O 9c  detected in the zero-threshold counter. The |b-delayed neutron         
 16O ac  probability P{-n}=(102.4 {I60})% was deduced.                          
 16O  c  1996Ra02,2003Mi01: In these experiments, authors observed              
 16O 2c  {+17}N(|b{+-}n) decay to calibrate the neutron energy and the neutron  
 16O 3c  counters. Neutron peaks at 380, 1170 and 1700 keV were observed.       
 16O 4c  The branching ratios of corresponding emissions from                   
 16O 5c  {+17}O*(4.55,5.38,5.94) to {+16}O{-g.s.} normalized to 95% {I1} are    
 16O 6c  39.5% {I46}, 49.1% {I46} and 6.4% {I10}, respectively (1996Ra02).      
 16O 7c  A fourth known peak at E{-n}=880 keV was too weak to be observed.      
 16O  c  2000Bu33,2001Gr06: A {+17}N beam was produced by fragmenting a 77 MeV/A
 16O 2c  {+18}O beam on a Be target; {+17}N was selected by the                 
 16O 3c  LISE3 spectrometer. Neutron time-of-flight (tof) and energy spectra    
 16O 4c  were obtained using the TONNERRE array which covered 45% of 4|p. The   
 16O 5c  intrinsic efficiency is rather high between 1 and 5 MeV. Neutron       
 16O 6c  groups at E{-n}=380, 1170 and 1710 keV were observed. Intensities are  
 16O 7c  not analyzed.                                                          
 16O  c  Comments:                                                              
 16O  c  For the population of bound {+17}O states, the |b-ray energy spectrum  
 16O 2c  analysis of (1964Si06) [Branching({+17}O*(0,870,3055)){-total}=(4.66   
 16O 3c  {I75}) and R=(1:(1.7 {I4}) for |b-decay to {+17}O{-g.s.} vs decay to   
 16O 4c  {+17}O*(870)] are combined with R=(9.6 {I4}):1 for the relative        
 16O 5c  intensities of E{-|g}=870 and 2170 keV |g-rays from (1976Al02).        
 16O  c  The data on decay feedings to bound states in {+17}O is sparse;        
 16O 2c  measurements are found in (1964Si06,1973Po11,1976Al02). The only       
 16O 3c  complete measurement on the decay populating {+17}O bound states is    
 16O 4c  found in (1964Si06); along with studying the |g radiations with a NaI  
 16O 5c  detector, they analyzed the |b radiations. In (1964Si06) the ratio of  
 16O 6c  the |b-decay to {+17}O{-g.s.} relative to feeding of {+17}O*(870) is   
 16O 7c  determined as 1:(1.7 {I4}); there is no other comparible measurement.  
 16O 8c  Further analysis of the |b-ray spectrum determined that the bound      
 16O 9c  {+17}O*(0,870,3055) states are populated in (4.66 {I75})% of decays.   
 16O ac  In (1973Po11), use of the (1964Si06) ground state result, along with   
 16O bc  analysis of their NaI data results in finding the branching ratio to   
 16O cc  {+17}O*(0,870,3055) as (5.14 {I72})%, but, as mentioned below, it is   
 16O dc  suggested that the E{-|g}=2170 keV intensity is enlarged by a          
 16O ec  systematic error associated with contributions from n+p capture. In    
 16O fc  (1973Po11) one finds the only reported connection between any neutron  
 16O gc  group intensity and a |g-ray transition intensity:                     
 16O hc  I(|g{-870 keV})/I(E{-n}=1.16 MeV)=(0.0667 {I95}).                      
 16O ic  In (1976Al02) the value R=(9.6 {I4}):1 for the relative                
 16O jc  intensities of E{-|g}=870 and 2170 keV |g-rays is found; they suggest  
 16O kc  the results of (1964Si06,1973Po11) are unreliable because neither      
 16O lc  group could resolve n+p capture |g rays from the 2170 keV decay        
 16O mc  transition; in spite of great caution described in those works this    
 16O nc  uncertainty discounts their E{-|g}=2170 keV intensities.               
 16O  c                                                                         
 16O  c  In all cases, the neutron group branching ratios are based on          
 16O 2c  relative intensity measurements that are normalized to unity with      
 16O 3c  inclusion of feedings to {+17}O bound states.                          
 16O  c  There are discrepancies among the relative intensities reported in     
 16O 2c  (1973De32,1973Po11,1976Al02,1976Oh05,1996Ra02). In the present analysis
 16O 3c  all measurements are considered; the results of (1973De32) appear to   
 16O 4c  deviate significantly from other measurements and are excluded from    
 16O 5c  analysis. The mean intensities from the remaining four measurements are
 16O 6c  determined, and these intensities are renormalized to yield            
 16O 7c  %|b-n=(100-(4.66 {I75}))=(95.34 {I75})%.

 16O 4c  new data on the feedings to bound states would be enlightening.

 17N 3c  target at GANIL were filtered with the LISE spectrometer and           
 17N 4c  implanted in a Si detector telescope. The telescope was surrounded by  
 17N 5c  a thin scintillator to detect |b-rays and a segmented                  
 17N 6c  NE102A 4|p neutron array (energy thresholds of 440 keV and 350 keV     
 17N 7c  for 1988Mu08 and 1989Le16, respectively).                              
 17N 8c  Following implantation of {+18}C in the telescope, the cyclotron       
 17N 9c  frequency was scrambled and the decay event was measured. Delayed      
 17N Ac  neutron emission probabilities of P{-n}=(25.0 {I45})% and (50 {I10})

 17N  c  1991Re02: spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
 17N 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 17N 3c  filter and transfered to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The           
 17N 4c  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
 17N 5c  nuclides. The ions were implanted in a Si detector, and identification 
 17N 6c  by standard techniques was implemented. The |b-delayed neutrons were   
 17N 7c  detected in a polyethylene moderated {+3}He counter; half-lives        
 17N 8c  and |b-delayed neutron probabilities were deduced from                 
 17N 9c  analysis of the number of implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the      
 17N Ac  rate of |b-delayed neutrons detected in the zero-threshold counter.    
 17N Bc  The |b-delayed neutron probability =(43.3 {I65})% was deduced.         
 17N  c  1991Pr03: a beam of {+18}C ions, produced by fragmenting a {+22}Ne beam
 17N 2c  on a Be and C target at GANIL, was purified in the LISE spectrometer   
 17N 3c  and implanted in a plastic scintillator. Decay events were recorded    
 17N 4c  via |b-detection in the scintillator and |g-ray measurements in a      
 17N 5c  HPGe detector. The decay lifetimes of the four strongest known {+18}C  
 17N 6c  |g-ray transitions {+18}C*(115,2614,880,472) were analyzed and the     
 17N 7c  {+18}C T{-1/2}=95 ms {I10} was deduced.                                
 17N  c  The authors aimed to resolve uncertainty in the                        
 17N 2c  |b{+-}0n and |b{+-}1n decay branches. The decay of {+18}C and {+18}N   
 17N 3c  were measured under identical experimental conditions; then, the ratio 
 17N 4c  of the intensity of the E|g=1982 keV, which is strongly populated      
 17N 5c  in {+18}N |b decay was analyzed to deduce the {+18}C |b-decay branch   
 17N 6c  that results in {+18}N population. %P{-|g}=81 {I5} was deduced; since  
 17N 7c  the only other decay path that is open is the |b{+-}1n decay to {+17}N 
 17N 8c  states, then %P{-n}=19 {I5} is deduced.                                
 17N  c  A total of 9 |g-ray transitions in {+18}N were identified along with   
 17N 2c  2 |g-ray transitions in {+17}N. The |g-ray intensities are presented   
 17N 3c  in two formats: first they are given in relative intensity normalized  
 17N 4c  to E|g=2614, the strongest transition. The measurement essentially     
 17N 5c  provided only the relative intensity of |g-ray transitions, hence there
 17N 6c  are no branching ratios correlated with, for example, per 100 decays.  
 17N 7c  The |g-ray data is further complicated by other experimental effects,  
 17N 8c  such as a close geometry has led to large summing corrections. In      
 17N 9c  addition a poor efficiency at low energies (coupled with a long-lived  
 17N Ac  first excited state) has led to large disagreement between feeding into
 17N Bc  the {+18}N*(115) level and |g-decay out of the level. In general there 
 17N Cc  appears to Be poor agreement between feeding into levels and decay     
 17N Dc  out of levels. It is difficult to judge the overall issue here         
 17N Ec  because the second and final presentation of |g-ray intensities is     
 17N Fc  for |g-decay out of each level normalized for the sum equal to 100.    
 17N Gc  In short there is no way to estimate the overall summing corrections   
 17N Hc  or to evaluate the intensity ballance for each state.                  
 17N  c  The authors also provide an estimate of the relative |b-decay feeding  
 17N 2c  into the {+18}N E{-x}=0, 115, 587, 1735 and 2614 keV levels of I|b=    
 17N 3c  0, 0, <1, 11 {I8} and 89 {I11%}. Using the |g-decay branching ratios   
 17N 4c  for each level, the relative |b-decay feeding and the P{-n} value it is
 17N 5c  possible to deduce a |b-decay scheme. However, because of the          
 17N 6c  issues above it is difficult to estimate the renormalization for the   
 17N 7c  |g-ray transitions for |g-decay in {+17}N. The E|g=879.7 keV transition
 17N 8c  between {+18}N*(2614 -->1735) is the strongest transition that has no  
 17N 9c  summing correction, so it seems most reasonable to scale with this.    
 17N  c  1995Sc03: a beam of {+18}C ions was produced by fragmenting a {+22}Ne  
 17N 2c  beam on a {+9}Be target. The beam was magnetically separated, degraded 
 17N 3c  to lower energies, and finally stopped in a plastic implantaion        
 17N 4c  scintillator detector. The beam carried a<4% {+20}N impurity.          
 17N 5c  The {+20}N ions were stopped in an absorber upstream of the            
 17N 6c  implantation detector, and no associated activity was observed.        
 17N 7c  The data were collected with a 206 ms beam-on/ 222 ms beam-off cycle.  
 17N  c  Neutrons were detected in one of 15 plastic scintallator bars that     
 17N 2c  formed an array surrounding the target with a 99.7 cm flight path.     
 17N 3c  The neutron energies were determined by ToF between the implantation   
 17N 4c  detector and the neutron array with E(n) energy threshold of 750 keV.  
 17N 5c  The ToF analysis permitted analysis of background events from          
 17N 6c  {+18}C decay daughters ({+18}N and {+17}N).                            
 17N 7c  Seven neutron energy groups were observed that are attributed to       
 17N 8c  {+18}C decay. The lack of neutron-|g coincidence data precludes the    
 17N 9c  assignment of any neutron groups to decays other than to the ground    
 17N Ac  state; hence, the analysis is carried out for this case. The intensity 
 17N Bc  of |b-delayed neutron decays was measured as %|b{+-}n=(21.4 {I44})%.

 17N  c  The P{-n}=(43.3 {I65})% value is accepted, the relative |b-decay       
 17N 2c  feeding to {+18}N levels and |g-ray branching ratios given in 1991Pr03 
 17N 3c  are accepted and should Be normalized for %|b{+-}0n=66.7 {I65}.        
 17N 4c  Significant |b{+-}1n decay strength is not accounted for.              
 17N 5c  The P{-n}=(43.3 {I65})% value of (1991Re02) is significantly larger    
 17N 6c  than the other findings. The zero-energy threshold                     
 17N 7c  of (1991Re02) is significantly lower than implemented in the           
 17N 8c  other measurements, hence involvement of |b-decay to states            
 17N 9c  that decay with low-energy neutrons may play a role in the decay.      
 17N  c  There are no known {+18}N levels above the neutron separation          
 17N 2c  threshold, so, at the moment the neutron energy groups may only Be     
 17N 3c  associated with decay to the ground state. There is evidence for       
 17N 4c  neutron decay to states at or above {+17}N*(1374,1849) since those     
 17N 5c  |g-ray decay radiations are observed. The relative intensities of the  
 17N 6c  {+17}N*(1374,1849) |g-ray transitions are normalized to the strength of
 17N 7c  the E|g=879.7 keV transition between {+17}N*(2614 ->1735) as described 
 17N 8c  above.

 17O  c  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
 17O 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 17O 3c  filter and transfered to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The beam line 
 17O 4c  was separately tuned to transport a number of different nuclides. The  
 17O 5c  ions were implanted in a Si detector, and identification by standard   
 17O 6c  techniques was implemented. The |b-delayed neutrons were detected in a 
 17O 7c  polyethylene moderated {+3}He counter; half-lives and |b-delayed       
 17O 8c  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
 17O 9c  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons    
 17O ac  detected in the zero-threshold counter. The |b-delayed neutron

 17O 4c  neutron detectors that covered 14.3% of 4|p, and neutron energies      
 17O 5c  were determined by time-of-flight between the implantation foil and    
 17O 6c  the neutron array.                                                     
 17O  c  The lifetime T{-1/2}=624 ms {I12} was measured. Nine neutron groups    
 17O 2c  with energies (branching ratios) of E{-n}=0.99 MeV {I3} (0.16 {I3})%,  
 17O 3c  1.16 MeV {I2} (0.39 {I9})%, 1.35 MeV {I2} (0.47 {I9})%, 1.55 MeV {I2}  
 17O 4c  (0.14 {I3})%, 1.77 MeV {I2} (0.17 {I3})%, 2.07 MeV {I3} (0.16 {I3})%,  
 17O 5c  2.46 MeV {I3} (0.43 {I9})%, 2.78 MeV {I3} (0.13 {I3})% and 3.26 MeV    
 17O 6c  {I3} (0.19 {I4})% were observed in the ToF spectrum. The total observed
 17O 7c  branching ratio (Branching) to neutron unbound levels is 2.2% {I4}.    
 17O  c  2005Li60: A thick Be target was bombarded by a 68.8 MeV/A {+22}Ne beam 
 17O 2c  to produce {+18}N ions that were selected and stopped in a thin plastic
 17O 3c  scintillation detector. Two different plastic scintillator arrays      
 17O 4c  (neutron walls) were used to detect delayed neutrons with coverage of  
 17O 5c  30% and 2.2% of 4|p sr for high energy and low energy, respectively.   
 17O 6c  The neutron detection efficiecies were calibrated with the known       
 17O 7c  {+17}N |b{+-}n decay neutron spectrum. A set of 3 HPGe detectors       
 17O 8c  were positioned around the target to measure |g-ray emissions.         
 17O  c  Beam was collected in the target for cycles of 2.0 s activation        
 17O 2c  periods followed by 2.0 s counting periods. The result                 
 17O 3c  T{-1/2}=619 ms {I2} was obtained from analysis of the |b-ray decay     
 17O 4c  curve observed in the thin plastic catcher foil; a small 5%            
 17O 5c  {+20}O (T{-1/2}=13.5 s) component was the main active beam contaminant.
 17O 6c  An exclusive gate on the on the strongest neutron peak at E{-n}=       
 17O 7c  0.58 MeV yielded the value T{-1/2}=610 ms {I23}.                       
 17O  c  Analysis of the ToF spectrum indicates decays of 11 neutron emitting   
 17O 2c  states in {+18}O with E{-n} (branching ratio)=0.58 MeV {I2}            
 17O 3c  (5.04 {I112})%, 0.79 MeV {I4} (0.28 {I6})%, 0.97 MeV {I2} (0.11 {I3})%,
 17O 4c  1.16 MeV {I3} (0.18 {I3})%, 1.35 MeV {I3} (0.24 {I4})%, 1.48 MeV {I3}  
 17O 5c  (0.05 {I2})%, 1.72 MeV {I3} (0.18 {I3})%, 1.98 MeV {I4} (0.11 {I3})%,  
 17O 6c  2.44 MeV {I4} (0.43 {I6})%, 2.70 MeV {I4} (0.13 {I2})% and 3.22 MeV    
 17O 7c  {I5} (0.23 {I3})%. The total observed Branching is 6.98% {I146}. The   
 17O 8c  |b-delayed |g-ray emissions were briefly discussed, though there is no 
 17O 9c  mention of any transitions observed in {+17}O; it is assumed that none 
 17O ac  are observed.                                                          
 17O  c  2007Lo05: A Be target was bombarded by a 68.8 MeV/A {+22}Ne beam       
 17O 2c  to produce {+18}N ions that were selected and stopped in a thin plastic
 17O 3c  scintillation detector. A neutron sphere composed of eight identical   
 17O 4c  plastic scintillator counters was used to detect delayed neutrons; each
 17O 5c  segment covered 3.75% of 4|p sr.                                       
 17O  c  Three T{-1/2} values were obtained by gating the |b-time spectrum      
 17O 2c  corresponding to various neutron peaks, 625 ms {I30}, 635 ms {I40} and 
 17O 3c  609 ms {I60}. In this measurement, the emphasis was on fast neutrons.  
 17O 4c  Nine neutron peaks were observed, eight are in good agreement with     
 17O 5c  2005Li60. Peaks are observed at  E{-n}=1.13 MeV {I3}, 1.35 MeV {I3},   
 17O 6c  1.58 MeV {I3}, 1.79 MeV {I3}, 2.05 MeV {I3}, 2.43 MeV {I4}, 2.76 MeV   
 17O 7c  {I4}, 3.22 MeV {I4} and 3.78 MeV {I5} (0.05 {I3})%. A new peak at      
 17O 8c  E{-n}(lab)=3.78 MeV {I5} was identified. The detection efficiency for  
 17O 9c  groups with E{-n} < 2.0 MeV was low, and therefore the proceedure for  
 17O ac  fitting of these peaks relied on prior analysis. The total observed    
 17O bc  |b-delayed Branching is 7.03% {I146}.                                  
 17O  c  In this experiment, the calibration using {+17}N provided the          
 17O 2c  neutron detection efficiency up to 1.73 MeV, the authors used the      
 17O 3c  efficiency curve obtained in 2005Li60 (efficiency up to 3.22 MeV) to   
 17O 4c  determine the absolute Branching of this new peak. The Branching of    
 17O 5c  0.05% {I3} corresponding to E{-x}({+18}O)=12.05 MeV {I5} and log       
 17O 6c  {Ift}=5.24 {I3} was deduced. This new state was also observed by       
 17O 7c  1995Se02 in an electron scattering experiment, who found the J|p=1- or 
 17O 8c  2+. The present authors concluded J|p=1-.                              
 17O  c  Comments:                                                              
 17O  c  P{-n}=12.0% {I13} is reported in the reanalysis of 1991Re02. Results   
 17O 2c  reported in (2005Li60, 2007Lo05) can account for only (7.03 {I146})%;  
 17O 3c  the missing strength of |? 5% is attributed to one or several states in
 17O 4c  {+18}O with 8.044 MeV |< E{-x} |< 8.50 MeV, where the corresponding    
 17O 5c  neutron group's emission energy is below the threshold of the neutron  
 17O 6c  detector systems.                                                      
 17O  c  No evidence was found for population of a broad state at E{-x} |? 9 MeV
 17O 2c  (suggested by 1989Zh04 in |b-delayed |a-emission); In 1994Sc01 an      
 17O 3c  upper limit for its Branching of |< 1% was deduced from the total      
 17O 4c  number of counts in the relevant energy range. Comparing with          
 17O 5c  1989Zh04, it can be concluded that most of the observed width          
 17O 6c  corresponds to the |G{-|a} of this state.                              
 17O  c  In 1994Sc01, neutron groups with a total Branching of 2.2% {I4} were   
 17O 2c  observed; a comparison with those same groups observed in              
 17O 3c  2005Li60 yields a slightly lower Branching of 1.66% {I28}. The         
 17O 4c  analysis of 2005Li60, which finds a total %|b{+-}n intensity of (7.0   
 17O 5c  {I15})%, is accepted. In addition 2007Lo05 taylored their sensitivity  
 17O 6c  to fast neutron groups, which were difficult to resolve, and a new     
 17O 7c  transition in the |b-delayed neutron decay is observed. No neutron     
 17O 8c  peaks between 3.78 and 5.5 MeV were observed.

 18C  c  1998Yo06: A beam of {+19}B was produced by fragmentation of a 95 MeV/A 
 18C 2c  {+40}Ar beam on a {+181}Ta target. {+19}B was selected using the RIKEN 
 18C 3c  Projectile-fragment Separator (RIPS) and was implanted into a 12 mm    
 18C 4c  thick plastic scintillator stopper. The |b-decays were observed during 
 18C 5c  the 100 ms beam-off period. The active stopper detected |b-rays and a  
 18C 6c  neutron detector array, consisting of 14 liquid scintillation counters 
 18C 7c  covering about 80% of 4|p detected delayed neutrons. The efficiency of 
 18C 8c  the neutron array was 30% by comparison of a measurement of |b-delayed 
 18C 9c  neutrons of {+15}B, which has a known delayed neutron emission         
 18C ac  probability of 100%.                                                   
 18C  c  A preliminary value of T{-1/2}=3.3 ms {I2} was dedcued from the        
 18C 2c  least-squares fits to the data, and P{-n}=125% {I32} was determined    
 18C 3c  from the ratio of the number of detected neutrons to that of |b-rays.  
 18C 4c  P{-n} is more than 100% which implies the existence of significant     
 18C 5c  multineutron emissions in the decay, reflecting its large Q{-|b} value 
 18C 6c  (26.5 MeV) compared with the multineutron separation energies of       
 18C 7c  daughter nucleus {+19}C (S{-1n}=160 keV, S{-2n}=4.4 MeV,.....).        
 18C  c  2003Yo02: The authors reevaluated the preliminary values T{-1/2} and   
 18C 2c  P{-n} reported in 1998Yo06. The new experiment was performed using     
 18C 3c  RIPS at RIKEN Accelerator Research Facility as was in 1998Yo06. A beam 
 18C 4c  of {+19}B was produced by the projectile-fragmentation reaction of a   
 18C 5c  95 MeV/{Iu} {+40}Ar beam on a 670 mg/cm{+2} {+nat}Ta target. The values
 18C 6c  of T{-1/2} and P{-{Ii}n} were determined by fitting a set of decay     
 18C 7c  curves altogether to remove possible complication and inconsistency.   
 18C 8c  The method of maximum likelihood was applied for deducing T{-1/2} and  
 18C 9c  P{-{Ii}n}. The neutron detection efficiencies were treated carefully,  
 18C ac  the total detection efficiencies of direct and scattered neutrons are  
 18C bc  31.5 % {I3} and 4.7% {I+2}{I-6}, respectively. The new values of       
 18C cc  T{-1/2}=2.92 ms {I13}, P{-1n}=71.8% {I+83}{I-91} and P{-2n}=16.0%      
 18C dc  {I+56}{I-48} were determined with a better precision. P{-3n} was not   
 18C ec  determined because of the limited statistics. In the text it is unclear
 18C fc  if the 1998Yo06 "preliminary" data are included in the 2003Yo02        
 18C gc  analysis; we assume that it is and use the 2003Yo02 result to avoid    
 18C hc  possible data correlations.

 18N  c  1995Oz02: A beam of {+19}C ions was produced by fragmenting a {+22}Ne  
 18N 2c  beam on a {+9}Be target. The beam was magnetically separated, degraded 
 18N 3c  to lower energies, and finally stopped in a plastic scintillator.      
 18N 4c  The implantation detector was sandwiched between four other            
 18N 5c  scintillator                                                           
 18N 6c  detectors, and a valid event required a coincidence between three      
 18N 7c  ajacent detectors. Three neutron walls surrounded the implantation     
 18N 8c  target and covered about 1.4 sr. The decay neutron energy was          
 18N 9c  deduced by the time of flight between the implantation detector and    
 18N Ac  the neutron wall detectors. The ToF was calibrated by studying the     
 18N Bc  decay of {+17}N which has three visible known neutron groups.          
 18N Cc  A set of two NaI detectors also faced the target for use measuring     
 18N Dc  |g-ray singles events and n-|g coincidence events.                     
 18N  c  The measured neutron spectrum shows several decay groups. A            
 18N 2c  significant {+17}B component was present in the beam, and its decay    
 18N 3c  radiations presented a background that was analyzed and subtracted.    
 18N 4c  The final analysis of the neutron energy spectrum revealed five        
 18N 5c  neutron groups that are attributed to |b delayed neutron decay of      
 18N 6c  {+19}C, or its daughter {+19}N.                                        
 18N  c  Throughout the experiment, ions were implanted for a 100 ms period     
 18N 2c  followed by a 200 ms counting period; analysis of the time dependence  
 18N 3c  for the neutron groups permitted assignment of four groups to decay    
 18N 4c  of {+19}C (T{-1/2}|?50 ms) and one group to decay of {+19}N            
 18N xc  (T{-1/2}|?320 ms).                                                     
 18N  c  Four neutron groups at E{-n}=0.46, 1.01, 1.50 and 2.08 are observed;

 18O  c  1986Du07: {+19}N ions from the fragmentation of a 60 MeV/u {+40}Ar     
 18O 2c  beam on a Be target at GANIL were filtered by the LISE spectrometer and
 18O 3c  implanted in a Ge detector.                                            
 18O 4c  Beta gamma coincidences of {+19}N were measured along with their       
 18O 5c  relative intensities. T{-1/2}=320 ms {I100} was also deduced.          
 18O  c  1988Sa04: {+19}N ions from the fragmentation of a 35 MeV/u {+22}Ne     
 18O 2c  beam on a Ta target at MSU were filtered by the RPMS and were          
 18O 3c  implanted in a Si telescope. Multiple neutron-rich isotopes were       
 18O 4c  separated and identified by the RPMS, and each of their half lives was 
 18O 5c  measured. All counts above a threshold of 0.3 MeV were recorded.       
 18O 6c  T{-1/2}=235 ms {I32} was deduced for {+19}N.                           
 18O  c  1988Mu08: {+19}N ions from the fragmentation of a 45 MeV/u {+48}Ca     
 18O 2c  beam on a {+181}Ta target at GANIL were filtered                       
 18O 3c  by the LISE spectrometer and implanted in a Si telescope.              
 18O 4c  The telescope was surrounded by a thin scintillator to detect |b-rays  
 18O 5c  and a segmented ne102a 4|p neutron array with an energy threshold of   
 18O 6c  350 keV.                                                               
 18O 7c  Following implantation of {+19}N in the telescope the cyclotron        
 18O 8c  frequecy was scrambled and the decay event was measured.               
 18O 9c  A delayed neutron emission probability of P{-n}=33 {I+34-11}% was      
 18O ac  deduced. T{-1/2}=210 ms {I+200-100} was also measured.                 
 18O  c  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
 18O 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 18O 3c  filter and transferred to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF.              
 18O 4c  The |b-delayed neutron probability P{-n}=62.4 {I2}.6% was deduced and  
 18O 5c  T{-1/2}=329 ms {I19} was measured.                                     
 18O 6c  A reanalysis of the (1991Re02) data, with additional data              
 18O 7c  was published in the International conference on nuclear data for      
 18O 8c  science and technology: nuclear data for the twenty-first century,     
 18O 9c  Gatlinburg, TN (United States), 9-13 May 1994. The reanalysis          
 18O ac  indicates P{-n}=(48.7 {I21})% and T{-1/2}=255 ms {I10}.                
 18O  c  2006Su12: {+19}N ions from fragmentation of an 80 MeV/u {+22}Ne beam   
 18O 2c  on a Be target were selected by the NSCL A1200 fragment separator and  
 18O 3c  implanted in a plastic scintillator. An array of curved plastic        
 18O 4c  scintillator bars surrounded the implantation target. The              
 18O 5c  time-of-flight between the implantation detector (beta counter) and the
 18O 6c  neutron detector array determined the neutron energies. Two HPGE       
 18O 7c  detectors measured |g rays. The neutron emission probability           
 18O 8c  Pn=(41.8 {I9})% was deduced from the neutron data. The analysis        
 18O 9c  revealed eight neutron groups to {+18}O states. |g transitions among   
 18O ac  excited states in {+19}O and {+18}O were also observed. A detailed     
 18O bc  decay scheme is suggested by comparison of the |g transition           
 18O cc  intensities amongst the {+19}O levels, |b-|g-n coincidences, and a     
 18O dc  reasonable placement of neutron group intensties that could give an    
 18O ec  intensity balance. Neutron emission groups with intensities less than  
 18O fc  1% are left unplaced in the decay scheme. T{-1/2}=336 ms {I3} was also 
 18O xc  measured.                                                              
 18O  c  Comments: The measurements of 2006Su12 provide the most complete       
 18O 2c  measure of {+19}O and {+18}O spectroscopy for levels and transitions   
 18O 3c  involved in the decay. 1986Du07 measured an additional |g ray energy   
 18O 4c  of 709.2 keV not detected by 2006Su12. This nonobservation can be      
 18O 5c  explained by a contaminant of {+22}O in the beam. 2006Su12 also        
 18O 6c  expresses two possible sources of gamma decay for the 2475.2 keV       
 18O 7c  transition. This energy is consistent with both the 1- to 2+           
 18O 8c  transition in {+18}O as well as the 3/2- to 1/2+ in {+19}O. It was     
 18O 9c  assigned to {+19}O; the intensity ratio in {+18}O should have an       
 18O ac  absolute intensity ratio of 13:5 and the observed intensity ratio was  
 18O xc  1:13.

 19N  c  1989Le16,1990Mu06: {+20}C particles were filtered using magnetic       
 19N 2c  analysis in the LISE spectrometer and identified with energy loss and  
 19N 3c  ToF measurements. The fragments were implanted in a Si detector        
 19N 4c  surrounded by a plastic scintillator for |b-ray detection. The target  
 19N 5c  was placed inside a 4|p neutron detector that had a neutron energy     
 19N 6c  threshold of 350keV. The {+20}C T{-1/2} reported in this work was 16   
 19N 7c  ms +14 -7 and P{-n}=50 30 was determined; values of T{-1/2}=14 ms      
 19N 8c  {I+6-5} and P{-n}=72 {I14}, which are apparently revised, were         
 19N xc  published in (1990Mu06).                                               
 19N  c  2003Yo02: {+20}C ions were produced at the RIKEN/RIPS facility and     
 19N 2c  implanted a plastic scintillator detector. An array of 13 liquid       
 19N 3c  scintillator detectors surrounded the implantation target. Following   
 19N 4c  implantation, |b and |b+n coincidence counting were carried            
 19N 5c  out for 100 ms (to permit decay of daughter & grandaughter activity).  
 19N 6c  Standard pulse shape analysis was used to identify high-energy         
 19N 7c  neutrons, while for 50 keV|<E{-eq}|<200 keV the time of flight         
 19N 8c  information was used to separate neutrons and |g rays. Analysis of the 
 19N 9c  1n- and 2n- coincidence events yielded values of P{-1n}=65 {I+19-18}   
 19N ac  and P{-2n}<18.6. T{-1/2}=21.8 ms +15.0-7.4 was also measured.          
 19N  c  In summary, T{-1/2}=14 ms {I+6-5} (1990Mu06) appears most reliable. In 
 19N 2c  (2003Yo02), limited statistics on {+20}C were obtained since it was a  
 19N 3c  contaminant to their beams of interest. The measured P{-1n} and        
 19N 4c  P{-2n} values are consistent with the P{-n} values deduced in          
 19N 5c  (1989Le16,1990Mu06), hence P{-1n}=65 {I+19-18} and P{-2n}<18.6 are     
 19N 6c  accepted; this implies %|b-0n|?35 {I20}. No information on             
 19N 7c  neutron-emission energies is given, but P{-1n}=65 {I+19-18} implies    
 19N 8c  that {+19}N{-g.s.} will be fed (by some decay path) in a significant   
 19N 9c  fraction of decays.

 19O  c  1986Du07: {+19}N ions from the fragmentation of a 60 MeV/u {+40}Ar     
 19O 2c  beam on a Be target at GANIL were filtered by the LISE spectrometer and

 19O  c  1988Sa04: {+19}N ions from the fragmentation of a 35 MeV/u {+22}Ne     
 19O 2c  beam on a Ta target at MSU were filtered by the RPMS and were          
 19O 3c  implanted in a Si telescope. Multiple neutron-rich isotopes were       
 19O 4c  separated and identified by the RPMS, and each of their half lives was 
 19O 5c  measured. All counts above a threshold of 0.3 MeV were recorded.       
 19O 6c  T{-1/2}=235 ms {I32} was deduced for {+19}N.                           
 19O  c  1988Mu08: {+19}N ions from the fragmentation of a 45 MeV/u {+48}Ca     
 19O 2c  beam on a {+181}Ta target at GANIL were filtered                       
 19O 3c  by the LISE spectrometer and implanted in a Si telescope.              
 19O 4c  The telescope was surrounded by a thin scintillator to detect |b-rays  
 19O 5c  and a segmented ne102a 4|p neutron array with an energy threshold of   
 19O 6c  350 keV.                                                               
 19O 7c  Following implantation of {+19}N in the telescope the cyclotron        
 19O 8c  frequecy was scrambled and the decay event was measured.               
 19O 9c  A delayed neutron emission probability of P{-n}=33 {I+34-11}% was      
 19O ac  deduced. T{-1/2}=210 ms {I+200-100} was also measured.                 
 19O  c  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
 19O 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 19O 3c  filter and transferred to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF.              
 19O 4c  The |b-delayed neutron probability P{-n}=62.4 {I2}.6% was deduced and  
 19O 5c  T{-1/2}=329 ms {I19} was measured.                                     
 19O 6c  A reanalysis of the (1991Re02) data, with additional data              
 19O 7c  was published in the International conference on nuclear data for      
 19O 8c  science and technology: nuclear data for the twenty-first century,     
 19O 9c  Gatlinburg, TN (United States), 9-13 May 1994. The reanalysis          
 19O ac  indicates P{-n}=(48.7 {I21})% and T{-1/2}=255 ms {I10}.                
 19O  c  2006Su12: {+19}N ions from fragmentation of an 80 MeV/u {+22}Ne beam   
 19O 2c  on a Be target were selected by the NSCL A1200 fragment separator and  
 19O 3c  implanted in a plastic scintillator. An array of curved plastic        
 19O 4c  scintillator bars surrounded the implantation target. The              
 19O 5c  time-of-flight between the implantation detector (beta counter) and the
 19O 6c  neutron detector array determined the neutron energies. Two HPGE       
 19O 7c  detectors measured |g rays. The neutron emission probability           
 19O 8c  Pn=(41.8 {I9})% was deduced from the neutron data. The analysis        
 19O 9c  revealed eight neutron groups to {+18}O states. |g transitions among   
 19O ac  excited states in {+19}O and {+18}O were also observed. A detailed     
 19O bc  decay scheme is suggested by comparison of the |g transition           
 19O cc  intensities amongst the {+19}O levels, |b-|g-n coincidences, and a     
 19O dc  reasonable placement of neutron group intensties that could give an    
 19O ec  intensity balance. Neutron emission groups with intensities less than  
 19O fc  1% are left unplaced in the decay scheme. T{-1/2}=336 ms {I3} was also 
 19O xc  measured.                                                              
 19O  c  Comments: The measurements of 2006Su12 provide the most complete       
 19O 2c  measure of {+19}O and {+18}O spectroscopy for levels and transitions   
 19O 3c  involved in the decay. 1986Du07 measured an additional |g ray energy   
 19O 4c  of 709.2 keV not detected by 2006Su12. This nonobservation can be      
 19O 5c  explained by a contaminant of {+22}O in the beam. 2006Su12 also        
 19O 6c  expresses two possible sources of gamma decay for the 2475.2 keV       
 19O 7c  transition. This energy is consistent with both the 1- to 2+           
 19O 8c  transition in {+18}O as well as the 3/2- to 1/2+ in {+19}O. It was     
 19O 9c  assigned to {+19}O; the intensity ratio in {+18}O should have an       
 19O ac  absolute intensity ratio of 13:5 and the observed intensity ratio was  
 19O xc  1:13.

 19O  c  1988Mu08: {+20}N ions from the fragmentation of a 45 MeV/u {+48}Ca     
 19O 2c  beam on a {+181}Ta target at GANIL were filtered by the LISE           
 19O 3c  spectrometer and implanted in a Si telescope. The telescope was        
 19O 4c  surrounded by a thin scintillator to detect |b-rays and a segmented    
 19O 5c  NE102A 4|p neutron array with an energy threshold of 350 keV.          
 19O 6c  Following implantation of {+20}N in the telescope the cyclotron        
 19O 7c  frequency was scrambled and the decay event was measured. A delayed    
 19O 8c  neutron emission probability of P{-n}=53 {I+11-7} % was deduced.       
 19O xc  T{-1/2}=100 ms {I+30-20} was also measured.                            
 19O  c  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
 19O 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 19O 3c  filter and transferred to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The          
 19O 4c  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
 19O 5c  nuclides. The neutrons were detected in a polyethylene moderate {+3}He 
 19O 6c  counter, and standard techniques were implemented. The |b-delayed      
 19O 7c  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
 19O 8c  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons    
 19O 9c  detected in the zero-threshold counter. The |b-delayed neutron         
 19O ac  probability P{-n}=(66.1 {I50})% was deduced. T{-1/2}=142 ms {I19} was  
 19O bc  also measured. A reanalysis of the (1991Re02) data, with additional    
 19O cc  data was published in the International conference on nuclear data for 
 19O dc  science and technology: nuclear data for the twenty-first century,     
 19O ec  Gatlinburg, TN (United States), 9-13 May 1994. The reanalysis          
 19O fc  indicates P{-n}=(52.0 {I33})% and T{-1/2}=129 ms {I8}.                 
 19O  c  2006Su12: {+20}N ions from fragmentation of an 80 MeV/u {+22}Ne beam   
 19O 2c  on a Be target were selected by the NSCL A1200 fragment separator and  
 19O 3c  implanted in a plastic scintillator. An array of curved plastic        
 19O 4c  scintillator bars surrounded the implantation target.                  
 19O 5c  The time-of-flight between the implantation detector (beta counter) and
 19O 6c  the neutron detector array determined the neutron energies. Two HPGE   
 19O 7c  detectors measured |g rays.                                            
 19O  c  The neutron emission probability P{-n}=(46 {I11})% was deduced from    
 19O 2c  the neutron data. The analysis revealed seven neutron groups           
 19O 3c  to {+19}O states. |g transitions among excited states in {+20}O and    
 19O 4c  {+19}O were also observed. A detailed decay scheme is suggested by     
 19O 5c  comparison of the |g transition intensities amongst the {+19}O levels, 
 19O 6c  and a reasonable placement of neutron group intensties that could give 
 19O 7c  an intensity balance. Low statistics apparently prevented a detailed   
 19O 8c  |b-|g-n comparison. T{-1/2}=136 ms {I3} was also measured.             
 19O  c  Comments: The measurements of 2006Su12 provide the only quantitative   
 19O 2c  measure of {+20}O and {+19}O spectroscopy for levels and transitions   
 19O 3c  involved in the decay. The %|b-1n=42.9 {I14} is deduced; furthermore,  
 19O 4c  only {+19}O*(96, 1472) levels are fed in the 1n decay. Beta-decay to   
 19O 5c  neutron bound levels in {+20}O is found to comprise (53.8 {I13})% of   
 19O 6c  decays with an additional upper limit of 3.3% feeding {+20}O{-g.s.}    
 19O xc  directly.                                                              
 19O  c  The P{-n}=P{-1n}+2P{-2n}=(52.0 {I33})% value from the revised          
 19O 2c  zero-threshold measurement of 1991Re02 can be combined with            
 19O 3c  P{-1n}=(42.9 {I14})% from 2006Su12 to estimate the value of P{-2n}|?   
 19O 4c  4.5%. The P{-2n} contribution in the decay was not considered when the 
 19O 5c  limit on direct feeding of {+20}O{-g.s.} was deduced.

 20O 5c  The time-of-flight between the implantation detector (beta             
 20O 6c  counter) and the neutron detector array determined the neutron         
 20O 7c  energies. Two HPGE detectors measured |g rays.                         
 20O  c  The neutron emission probability Pn=(46 {I11})% was deduced from       
 20O 2c  the neutron data. The analysis revealed seven neutron groups           
 20O 3c  to {+19}O states. |g transitions among excited states in {+20}O and    
 20O 4c  {+19}O were also observed. A detailed decay scheme is suggested by     
 20O 5c  comparison of the |g transition intensities amongst the {+19}O levels, 
 20O 6c  and a reasonable placement of neutron group intensties that could give 
 20O 7c  an intensity balance. Low statistics apparently prevented a detailed   
 20O 8c  beta-gamma-n comparison.                                               
 20O 9c  T{-1/2}=136 ms {I3} was also measured.                                 
 20O  c  Comments: The measurements of 2006Su12 provide the only quantitative   
 20O 2c  measure of {+20}O and {+19}O spectroscopy for levels and transitions   
 20O 3c  involved in the decay. The %|b-1n=42.9 {I14} is deduced from feeding to
 20O 4c  {+19}O*(96, 1472), which are the only {+19}O levels are fed in the     
 20O 5c  decay. Beta-decay to neutron                                           
 20O 6c  bound levels in {+20}O is found to comprise (53.8 {I13})% of decays    
 20O 7c  with an additional                                                     
 20O 8c  upper limit of 3.3% feeding {+20}O{-g.s.} directly.

 20O 2c  zero-threshold measurement of 1991Re02 can be combined with            
 20O 3c  P{-1n}=(42.9 {I14})% from 2006Su12 to estimate the value of

 26F 2cL 657 keV {I7}, 2+ level reported in 2012St01 (Phys. Rev. C85, 017303),  
 26F 3cL albeit with a weak confidence. In this scenario, the 657-keV, 4+       
 26F 4cL isomer will decay via a 2+ state of very low energy (up to 10 keV in   
 26F 5cL consistency with Weisskopf lifetime estimates) and then by the 643.4|g 
 26F 6cL to the 1+ ground state. Further, 2013Le03 state that the energy of the 
 26F 7cL isomer is |?650 {I10} keV                                              
 26F  cL J$From shell model calculations in 2013Le03, assuming 643.4|g as a

 26F 4cL as 657 keV {I7} reported in 2012St01 (Phys. Rev. C85, 017303), the     
 26F 5cL hypothesis of isomerism of 4+ state would be due to the emission of a  
 26F 6cL very low energy 4+ to 2+ transition (up to 10 keV to ensure having a   
 26F 7cL long-lived isomer), then followed by 2+ to 1+ transition - noted in

 28MG2c  produced from fragmentation of tantalum targets by 500 MeV protons at  
 28MG3c  TRIUMF. Separated {+28}Na{++} beam, E=30.6 keV, was neutralized by     
 28MG4c  colliding with the Na vapor and nuclear spin was polarized (|?50%)     
 28MG5c  by collinear optical pumping. Polarized {+28}Na beam was ionized and   
 28MG6c  transported with the polarization direction perpendicular to the beam  
 28MG7c  direction. The spin orientation was flipped by changing the laser      
 28MG8c  helicity in every 5 minutes. The beam was focused and stopped on a Pt  
 28MG9c  foil. E|g, I|g, |b-|g and |g-|g coincidence measurements were performed
 28MGac  using 9 HPGe detectors. A pair of plastic scintillators placed in front

 29CL2c  of {+30}Ar decay by in-flight decay spectroscopy of particle spectra   
 29CL3c  and analysis of reaction kinematics. {+30}Ar produced in one-neutron   
 29CL4c  knockout from {+31}Ar. The secondary {+31}Ar beam at 620 MeV/nucleon   
 29CL5c  was produced in {+9}Be({+36}Ar,X),E=885 MeV/nucleon primary            
 29CL6c  fragmentation reaction at SIS-GSI accelerator facility. {+31}Ar ions   
 29CL7c  separated by using the fragment separator FRS. Secondary {+9}Be target 
 29CL8c  was 4.8 g/cm{+2} thick. The {+30}Ar ions were produced in one-neutron  
 29CL9c  knockout reaction. Measured positions and angular correlations of      
 29CLAc  {+30}Ar in-flight decay products such as coincident two protons        
 29CLBc  (emitted by the decay of {+30}Ar) and heavy-ion recoil such as {+28}S

 31S 5c  1203.7-keV proton group is shown to be in coin with a 2230-keV |g ray  
 31S 6c  (presumably corresponding to known 2236|g in {+31}S), but in 2008Bh08, 
 31S 7c  this proton group was observed strongly in coin with 1248|g from the   
 31S 8c  first excited state of {+31}S. Moreover the deduced level excitation   
 31S 9c  energy quoted by 2007DoZX as 6295 for the 1203.7 proton group seems    
 31S Ac  seems to be in error if this group is in coin with 2236|g. In view of  
 31S Bc  the lack of sufficient details in 2007DoZX and noted inconsistencies,

 31S 2cDP available data however neither of these data sets are complete and so 
 31S 3cDP the data have been first scaled so that the super allowed proton      
 31S 4cDP branch intensities were equal, then data sets were combined and

 31CL c  Most studies deal with measurement of delayed protons following        
 31CL2c  |e+|b{++} decay. No |g-rays are observed in the decay of               
 31CL3c  {+31}Ar to {+31}Cl since the first excited state is                    
 31CL4c  unbound towards proton emission.                                       
 31CL c  2009Wr03: in the analysis of {+30}S(p,|g){+31}Cl reaction rates they   
 31CL2c  refer to two resonances in {+31}Cl at 461 {I15} and 1462 {I5},         
 31CL3c  apparently from beta decay experiments of 1998Ax01. It should be noted 
 31CL4c  however that the so-called first excited state at 754 (resonance at    
 31CL5c  461) is non-existent in the most recent work from the authors of       
 31CL6c  1998Ax01. Although a level is expected from mirror arguments.          
 31CL c  2000Fy01: {+31}Ar from 1 GeV protons bombarding CaO target.            
 31CL2c  Measured protons, |bp and |bpp coin, pp energy correlations.           
 31CL3c  15 p-i-n diodes, a double sided Si strip and surface barrier detector  
 31CL4c  used to distinguish p from |b and measure protons, p|b, |bpp coin. A   
 31CL5c  HPGe was also used for |g-ray detection. 1999Fy01 from the same group  
 31CL6c  measured upper limit of delayed three-proton decay mode. See also      
 31CL7c  2002Bo29, 2002Fy01 and 1999Th09                                        
 31CL c  1998Ax02 (from same group as 2000Fy01): measured E(p), I(p), |bp coin, 
 31CL2c  |b2p coin, |b|g coin. See 2000Fy01 for details                         
 31CL c  1998Ax01 (from same group as 2000Fy01): mainly on measurement of       
 31CL2c  two-proton emission from {+31}Ar decay; three proton groups reported.  
 31CL3c  See 2000Fy01 for details. 1998Mu06 is a conference report from the     
 31CL4c  same group.

 31CL2c  selected out the {+31}Ar which was implanted in a Si detector.         
 31CL3c  Additional Si telescopes allowed measurement of |bp and |bpp coin.     
 31CL4c  Other papers by the same group: 1987Bo36, 1991Bo32. It appears         
 31CL5c  that there is an energy shift of as much as 400 keV between the        
 31CL6c  spectra of 1992Ba01 and 2000Fy01, the former being higher. A proton    
 31CL7c  peak at 9260 keV reported in 1992Ba01 possibly corresponds to          
 31CL8c  8860 keV group in 2000Fy01                                             
 31CL c  1990Bo24: {+31}Ar produced by 600-MeV protons bombarding CaO target.   
 31CL2c  Mass separation measured E(p) and |bp coin and pp coin. No evidence    
 31CL3c  found for two-proton decay

 31CL6cE the uncertainties for feedings to 2444 level since 2000Fy01            
 31CL7cE did not seem to account for the uncertainty in the normalization       
 31CL8cE factor of 0.29 {I3} from 1992Ba01 and 1991Bo32. It should be noted that
 31CL9cE 15% {I8} of the delayed-proton decay branch is still unaccounted for.

 31CL6cL as 2000Fy01) proposed many additional levels based on their observed   
 31CL7cL proton branches, but 2000Fy01 state that several assignments in        
 31CL8cL 1998Ax02 of proton groups to corresponding levels in {+31}Cl were      
 31CL9cL incorrect since the two-proton branches were not appropriately         
 31CLAcL considered. Some proton branches (446, 754, 844, 974, 4466 and 4624

 31CL3cL In 1998Ax02 a very weak proton group from {+31}Ar decay was proposed at
 31CL4cL 446 {I15} leading to excited state in {+31}Cl at 740 {I50} but in their
 31CL5cL later paper 2000Fy01 this peak was not discussed and the low energy    
 31CL6cL portion of the proton spectrum in 1998Ax02 was mostly ascribed to      
 31CL7cL delayed two proton decay. Communication with M.J.G. Borge of 1998Ax02  
 31CL8cL and 2000Fy01 suggested that further experiments are planned to confirm 
 31CL9cL the low-energy peak in 1998Ax02 which may have escaped detection in    
 31CLAcL 2000Fy01 due to threshold issues. See 2009Wr03 for discussion of this

 32CL c  2008Bh08: {+32}Ar produced in the reaction {+9}Be({+36}Ar,X) with a    
 32CL2c  100 MeV/nucleon beam at NSCL. A1200 fragment separator.                
 32CL3c  53.28 MeV/nucleon {+32}Ar beam implanted in a P/N silicon detector.    
 32CL4c  Measured E|g, I|g, delayed protons, p|g coin using HPGe detectors      
 32CL5c  (3 four-fold segmented clovers and 2 monolithic crystals) and          
 32CL6c  silicon detectors. The {Ift} value of T=2, superallowed transition     
 32CL7c  from 0+ parent state of {+32}Ar to 0+ excited state at 5246 keV in     
 32CL8c  {+32}Cl was determined.                                                
 32CL9c  Absolute intensities of proton groups measured from the determination  
 32CLAc  of total number of implanted {+32}Ar ions and detector efficiencies.   
 32CLBc  S(p)({+32}Cl)=1581.3 {I6} (2008Bh08), from energy of the IAS at 5046.4 
 32CLCc  keV in {+32}Cl and E(c.m.)=3465.0 {I4} (from ISOLDE data yet to be     
 32CLDc  published) for total kinetic energy of                                 
 32CLEc  proton group and {+31}S level energy in the superallowed decay.        
 32CLFc  2003Au03 give S(p)({+32}Cl)=1574 {I7}                                  
 32CLGc  From this experiment 2008Bh08 deduced isospin symmetry breaking        
 32CLHc  correction in {+32}Ar decay |d{-C}{+exp}=2.1% {I8}.

 32CLJc  in their paper) which are expected to appear in a future publication   
 32CL d  2006BoZZ is from the same group as 2008Bh08                            
 32CL c  1985Bj01: E=600 MeV protons on CaO target producing {+32}Ar through    
 32CL2c  spallation. Mass separated through ISOLDE-I. Measured half-life,       
 32CL3c  Ep, E|g, Ip, I|g, p|b|g coincidences, branching ratio. Proton          
 32CL4c  energies measured using silicon detectors; germanium detector for

 32CL3c  using Si detector.

 32CL c  2007DoZX: Measured proton energies and intensities of 19 groups        
 32CL2c  at GANIL facility, p|g coin. The protons range from 594.1 to 6056      
 32CL3c  keV. Most of these groups are in agreement with those from 2008Bh08    
 32CL4c  and earlier studies. However, one severe discrepancy is noted that     
 32CL5c  1203.7-keV proton group is shown to be in coin with a 2230-keV |g ray  
 32CL6c  (presumably corresponding to known 2236|g in {+31}S), but in 2008Bh08, 
 32CL7c  this proton group was observed strongly in coin with 1248|g from the   
 32CL8c  first excited state of {+31}S. Moreover the deduced level excitation   
 32CL9c  energy quoted by 2007DoZX as 6295 for the 1203.7 proton group seems    
 32CLAc  to be in error if this group is in coin with 2236|g. In view of        
 32CLBc  the lack of sufficient details in 2007DoZX and noted inconsistencies,  
 32CLCc  the evaluators feel that it is premature to consider data from         
 32CLDc  2007DoZX for current evaluation.

 33MG cG $ 2001Nu02 considered different scenarios for the placement            
 33MG2cG of 546|g and proposed placement from 705 level to a 159 level as       
 33MG3cG the probable one. However, this |g could also define a level of        
 33MG4cG this energy, a possibility which 2001Nu02 considered less likely       
 33MG5cG based on rather weak arguments. 2006El03 observed a 561 {I17} |g       
 33MG6cG in {+1}H({+34}Mg,{+33}Mg|g), which they suggested was most likely      
 33MG7cG the same as 546.2|g in decay work, but no 704.9|g was seen             
 33MG8cG in this study, which may imply that 546.2|g and 704.9|g de-excite      
 33MG9cG different levels. In Adopted Levels, Gammas, the evaluators            
 33MGAcG have defined a level at 546.2 keV.

 33CL c  The normalization of I|b in 1998En04 is wrong because a value of       
 33CL2c  38.7% was mistakenly used for the I|b of the decay branch to the

 33CL t      1. E{-x}=E{-p}*1.031522+2276.7 for decay to {+32}S ground state.   
 33CL t      2. In 1987Bo21, E{-p} after 3690 were corrected for pulse height   
 33CL t         effect by E{-p}(new)=E{-p}*1.01611-52.3618. The correction      
 33CL t         formula was obtained from the comparison of the 1987Bo21 data   
 33CL t         with 1993Sc16 data.                                             
 33CL t      3. In 1993Sc16, E{-p}=1665 and 1750 from p0 decay but have been    
 33CL t         changed to p1 decay in En98.                                    
 33CL t      4. In 2010Ad03, E{-p}=3066,3469, 3926, 4209, 4330, 4505 from p1    
 33CL t         decay but from p0 decay in En98; E{-p}=1665 from p2 decay but   
 33CL t         from p1 decay in En98.                                          
 33CL t      5. Adopted proton energy is from weighted average if applicable.   
 33CL t      6. Adopted decay mode in 2010Ad03 because it has better p|g        
 33CL t         coincidence data.                                               
 33CL t      7. All proton energies have been corrected for the internal        
 33CL t         calibration using the new values of the calibration peaks in    
 33CL t         2010Ad03 (1643.4 (13) keV and 3171.1 (10) keV).

 35P  cG E(B)$ Placement from 1988DuZS. In 1988DuZT, this |g was placed from a  
 35P 2cG 6095.8 (there is a legibility problem in this report as the level may  
 35P 3cG be read as 6035.8, as seems to have been done in 1990En08 evaluation). 
 35P 4cG However, in view of in-beam results from 2008Wi09, 1994.8|g most likely
 35P 5cG deexcites a 4381 level, not a 6095 level

 36K 3cL uncertainties by 2001Lo11, 1997Tr05, and 1995Ga16 for the unbound      
 36K 4cL levels listed in the table (3364 to 6794). However neither S(p) nor the
 36K 5cL proton energies leading to levels in {+35}Ar, from which E(level)'s    
 36K 6cL could Be calculated, are consistently given by the references          
 36K 7cL mentioned above. Consequently the more precise S(p)=1658.9 {I8}        
 36K 8cL (2011AuZZ) is used here to recalculate E(level) as follows:

 37SI4c  using the BigRIPS spectrometer, with energy loss measured by a         
 37SI5c  multi-sampling ionization chamber (MUSIC) and positions by PPACs.      
 37SI6c  Ions after separation and selection were implanted into the CAITEN     
 37SI7c  detector consisting of a segmented movable hollow-cylindrical-shape    
 37SI8c  plastic scintillator and a stationary ring of 24 position-sensitive    
 37SI9c  photomultiplier tubes (PSPMTs). |g rays were detected by three HPGe    
 37SIac  detectors (FWHM=2.1 keV at 1.33 MeV, 1.05 keV at 122 keV). Measured    
 37SIbc  E|g, I|g, implantation-decay-correlation, |b|g-coin, |g|g-coin,        
 37SIcc  |b|g(t). Deduced levels, J, |p, half-life, |g-ray branching ratios,    
 37SIdc  |b-decay branching ratios. Comparison with shell-model calculations.   
 37SI c  {+37}Al also decays to {+36}Si by |b{+-}n (|>38% {I3}) and probably to 
 37SI2c  {+35}Si by |b{+-}2n (|>1% {I1}) (2013StZY). Since these |b-delayed     
 37SI3c  neutron decay branches were not measured, the decay scheme given here  
 37SI4c  is incomplete.

 38CA cDPE$ This proton group was interpreted by 2001Gi01 as due to delayed     
 38CA2cDP two-proton emission from {+39}Ti via the IAS in {+39}Sc. Using this   
 38CA3cDP 2007Do17 attempt mass analysis of the 3-member mass multiplet:        
 38CA4cDP {+39}Cl, {+39}Ar and {+39}Sc using IMME technique. However, 2007Do17  
 38CA5cDP consider the placement of this proton group as questionable.          
 38CA6cDP Possibility of this group associated with decay of IAS in {+39}Sc     
 38CA7cDP to the third excited state in {+38}Ca is less likely since no |g      
 38CA8cDP coincidences were observed. The level fed by proton transition may    
 38CA9cDP decay by |g transition directly to the g.s. 2007Do17 conclude that    
 38CAAcDP a firm assignment of this proton group needs better and higher

 40AR cB IB$ only available experimental value is 9% from E.L. Robinson         
 40AR2cB (M.S. thesis, Purdue, 1958). This value has been quoted in several     
 40AR3cB papers (1989Mi03,1981HuZT,1972Kl06,1970Ke12) and in Endt's

 40AR5cB data, suggesting equal feedings to the ground state and the first      
 40AR6cB excited state. The singles |b spectrum of 1989Mi03 does show that      
 40AR7cB there is a direct feeding to the ground state, but in the opinion

 40AR c  The decay scheme, which includes the |b{+-} decay to the               
 40AR2c  ground state of {+40}Ca and two levels in {+40}Ar, is complete since   
 40AR3c  these are the only levels in the daughter nuclides below the           
 40AR4c  respective decay energies.                                             
 40AR c  In principle, the 1460-keV |g ray could be used for energy             
 40AR2c  calibration. However, in a Ge semiconductor detector the               
 40AR3c  apparent |g-ray energy depends on the source-detector                  
 40AR4c  configuration and {+40}K sources usually consist of a large volume     
 40AR5c  of material, so this E|g is usually not useful. This also means        
 40AR6c  that in most cases the uncertainty in the observed energy is           
 40AR7c  much larger than that given here.

 40K 6cP papers used natural abundance of {+40}K as 0.01167% {I2} (1975Ga24).   
 40K 7cP The natural abundance of {+40}K=0.0117% {I1} (as recommended in the    
 40K 8cP International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry 70, 217 (1998),      
 40K 9cP based on the measured value of 1975Ga24) would give about four times

 40K  dP T$ 1.277|*10{+9} y {I8} from evaluation of 1973EnVA, where the |b{++}  
 40K 2dP branch to the {+40}Ar ground state, whose intensity has been measured, 
 40K 3dP was taken into account, but it appears that the corresponding |e decay 
 40K 4dP was neglected. The |e/|b{++} ratio for this 3U transition has been     
 40K 5dP estimated as follows. For a 1U transition, the theoretical value       
 40K 6dP for this ratio is 8.5 and for a 2U transition it is 45.2. If           
 40K 7dP the 3U ratio is larger by the same factor, 45.2/8.5, than the          
 40K 8dP |e/|b{++} ratio is |?240. In the calculation of t{-1/2}, a value of    
 40K 9dP 200 {I100} was used. The revised |b{+-}, |b{++}, and |e branchings are 
 40K AdP given in the corresponding tables and are based on the |g/|b{+-} and   
 40K BdP |b{++}/|b{+-} data in 1973EnVA. There are 1.5405|*10{+22} atoms of

 40K DdP and an atomic abundance of 1.178|*10{+-4} {I4} (1973EnVA). From the    
 40K EdP measured |b{+-} activity of 27.89 {I15} per second for 1 g of natural  
 40K FdP K and I(|b{+-})=89.14% {I11}, the total activity is 31.29 {I17} per s  
 40K GdP and T{-1/2}=4.0207|*10{+16} s or 1.274|*10{+9} y {I8}. With a later    
 40K HdP value of {+40}K/K=1.17|*10{+-4} {I1} (1990Ho28),

 40K  dP T$ 1.277|*10{+9} y {I8} from evaluation of 1973EnVA, where the |b{++}  
 40K 2dP branch to the {+40}Ar ground state, whose intensity has been measured, 
 40K 3dP was taken into account, but it appears that the corresponding |e decay 
 40K 4dP was neglected. The |e/|b{++} ratio for this 3U transition has been     
 40K 5dP estimated as follows. For a 1U transition, the theoretical value       
 40K 6dP for this ratio is 8.5 and for a 2U transition it is 45.2. If           
 40K 7dP the 3U ratio is larger by the same factor, 45.2/8.5, than the          
 40K 8dP |e/|b{++} ratio is |?240. In the calculation of t{-1/2}, a value of    
 40K 9dP 200 {I100} was used. The revised |b{+-}, |b{++}, and |e branchings are 
 40K AdP given in the corresponding tables and are based on the |g/|b{+-} and   
 40K BdP |b{++}/|b{+-} data in 1973EnVA. There are 1.5405|*10{+22} atoms of     
 40K CdP {+40}K per gram of natural K based on an average atomic mass of 39.095 
 40K DdP and an atomic abundance of 1.178|*10{+-4} {I4} (1973EnVA). From the    
 40K EdP measured |b{+-} activity of 27.89 {I15} per second for 1 g of natural  
 40K FdP K and I(|b{+-})=89.14% {I11}, the total activity is 31.29 {I17} per s  
 40K GdP and T{-1/2}=4.0207|*10{+16} s or 1.274|*10{+9} y {I8}. With a later

 42AR3cG 1998WiZX. On the other hand, %I|b=19 (1989Mi03) would imply a much

 42TI2c  MeV/nucleon {+58}Ni beam on a 250 mg/cm{+2} natural nickel target at   
 42TI3c  SISSE/LISE3 facility in GANIL. Fragments were selected by the          
 42TI4c  |a-LISE3 separator and identified by tof and energy-loss with two      
 42TI5c  micro-channel plate (MCP) detectors and a detection setup consisting   
 42TI6c  of silicon and germanium detectors. Double-sided silicon-strip         
 42TI7c  detectors (DSSSD) and a thick Si(Li) detector were used to detect      
 42TI8c  implanted events, charged particles and |b particles. The |g rays were 
 42TI9c  detected by four Ge detectors. Measured Ep, Ip, E|g, I|g, p|g-coin,    
 42TIAc  T{-1/2}. Deduced levels, proton decay branching ratios.

 42TI2c  MeV/nucleon {+58}Ni beam on an 800 mg/cm{+2} natural nickel target at  
 42TI3c  NSCL. Fragments were selected using the A1900 separator and identified 
 42TI4c  by time-of-flight (tof) and energy-loss. Measured Ep, Ip, T{-1/2}.     
 42TI5c  Deduced proton decay branching ratios.                                 
 42TI c  2012Au08: {+43}Cr nuclei produced in the reaction Ni({+58}Ni,X) using  
 42TI2c  the LISE3 separator at GANIL. {+43}Cr ions were separated, identified  
 42TI3c  and then implanted onto the time projection chamber (TPC).             
 42TI4c  Decays were detected in a time-projection chamber (TPC), where signals 
 42TI5c  from four gas electron multipliers (GEM) detected in a two-dimensional 
 42TI6c  strip detector combined with drift-time analysis were used to          
 42TI7c  reconstruct the tracks of the particles in three dimensions.           
 42TI8c  Characterization of the TCP was done with the |b{++}p decay of {+52}Ni 
 42TI9c  with reference to proton energies and branching ratios.                
 42TIac  Measured energy loss, decay event counts, angular correlation between  
 42TIbc  two protons. Deduced branching ratio. Implantation and decay events    
 42TIdc  were time correlated. Simulations were  performed taking account       
 42TIec  different ratios of the decay energy shared between the two protons.   
 42TIfc  180 events were recorded for {+43}Cr |b{++}2p emission. Correlations

 42TI2cL From simulations studies and in comparison with the experimental       
 42TI3cL results, 2012Au08 show that two protons do not share equally the 2p    
 42TI4cL decay energy of 4363 keV {I19} (2007Do17) and are emitted in sequence. 
 42TI5cL A ratio of 34%-66% between the two protons is in good agreement with   
 42TI6cL experimental data in 2012Au08. In addition the angular correlation     
 42TI7cL measured between the two protons in 2012Au08 shows an isotropic        
 42TI8cL distribution of the relative angle between the two protons which is a  
 42TI9cL signature of sequential emission. 2012Au08 conclude that |b{++}-delayed
 42TIacL emission of protons proceeds in a sequential process via an            
 42TIbcL intermediate state in {+42}Ti at either 5.2 or 6.6 MeV in {+42}Ti. As  
 42TIccL the level density is quite high in this energy region, no definite     
 42TIdcL level energy can be assigned

 43CR c  2012Au08: visualization of two individual protons from a 2p decay mode.
 43CR2c  This study was a new analysis of data from the first observation of    
 43CR3c  two proton decay data in {+45}Fe that has already been presented in    
 43CR4c  2007Gi10. {+45}Fe nuclei were produced in the reaction Ni({+58}Ni,X)   
 43CR6c  using the LISE3 separator at GANIL. {+45}Fe ions were separated,       
 43CR7c  identified and then implanted onto the time projection chamber (TPC).  
 43CR8c  The identification was done by measuring energy loss in the first Si   
 43CR9c  detector and tof between the micro-channel plate and the Si detector.  
 43CRac  Decays were detected in a time-projection chamber (TPC),               
 43CRbc  where signals from four gas electron multipliers (GEM) detected in a   
 43CRcc  two-dimensional strip detector combined with drift-time analysis were  
 43CRdc  used to reconstruct the tracks of the particles in three               
 43CRec  dimensions. Characterization of the TCP was done with the |b{++}p decay
 43CRfc  of {+52}Ni with reference to proton energies and branching ratios.     
 43CRgc  Measured energy loss, decay event counts,                              
 43CRhc  angular correlation between two protons. Deduced T{-1/2} of {+45}Fe,   
 43CRic  branching ratio. Experimental T{-1/2} of {+45}Fe was compared with     
 43CRjc  predictions from three-body model. Implantation and decay events were  
 43CRkc  time correlated with ten events were recorded for {+45}Fe implantations
 43CRlc  and seven events recorded for the 2p decay of {+45}Fe.                 
 43CRmc  Other recorded events in this study: |b{++} delayed one-proton decay   
 43CRnc  (one event) and |b{++} delayed two-proton decay (two events).          
 43CRoc  This study was a new analysis of data from the first observation of    
 43CRpc  two proton decay data in {+45}Fe that has already been presented in

 43CR3c  separated from other reaction products by the A1900 fragment separator.
 43CR4c  Decays of {+45}Fe were detected using the Optical Time Projection      
 43CR5c  Chamber (OTPC), consisting of parallel wire mesh electrodes and filled 
 43CR6c  with a gas mixture of 66% He, 32% Ar, 1% N{-2}, 1% CH{-4}. Incoming    
 43CR7c  {+45}Fe ions and their decay products induce ionizing electrons along  
 43CR8c  their trajectories which result in a camera signal, and a              
 43CR9c  photo-multiplier signal which are used to reconstruct the particle     
 43CRAc  momentum. Two dgf-4C modules record |DE and time-of-flight information.
 43CRBc  Measured decay particle spectra, half-lives, branching ratios and      
 43CRCc  angular and energy correlations between the two protons emitted from   
 43CRDc  the {+45}Fe ground state.

 43CR3c  for the first time in a 2-proton decay mode using a time-projection    
 43CR4c  chamber. Measured half-life and total decay energy. A total of ten     
 43CR5c  {+45}Fe implantations were recorded

 44CA d  This decay-data evaluation was done under the                          
 44CA2d  collaboration which includes evaluators at Laboratoire Primaire des    
 44CA3d  Rayonnments Ionisants (LPRI) in France; Physikalisch-Technische

 44CA7d  National Laboratory (LBNL) and Idaho National Engineering and          
 44CA8d  Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in the United States.                 
 44CA9d  This evaluation was reviewed and                                       
 44CAad  accepted by evaluators in this collaboration.                          
 44CA c  The evaluator applied the Limitation of Relative Statistical Weights   
 44CA2c  (LWM) method (1988WoZO) for averaging numbers throughout this          
 44CA3c  evaluation. To avoid overestimating precision because of possible data 
 44CA4c  correlation, the uncertainty assigned to the average was always equal  
 44CA5c  to or greater than the smallest uncertainty of the values used to      
 44CA6c  calculate the average.                                                 
 44CA c  The adopted half-life of {+44}Sc, 3.97 h {I4}, is an average (lwm)     
 44CA2c  of 3.927 h {I8} (1969Ra16), 4.00 h {I2} (1966Ta01), and 4.05 h {I3}    
 44CA3c  (1969Sa34). Others: 3.9 h (1963Di06), 4.04 h (1961Ra06), 4.01 h        
 44CA4c  (1961Kh06), 3.92 h 3 (1945Hi05).                                       
 44CA c  The total average radiation energy of 3653.3 keV 25 (which includes    
 44CA2c  all the radiations emitted by {+44}Sc), calculated with the computer   
 44CA3c  program RADLST, agrees very well with Q(|e)=3652.5 keV {i18} (2011AuZZ)
 44CA4c  and confirms the quality and completeness of the {+44}Sc decay scheme.

 44SC2c  (LWM) method (1988WoZO) for averaging numbers throughout this          
 44SC3c  evaluation. To avoid overestimating precision because of possible data 
 44SC4c  correlation, the uncertainty assigned to the average was always equal  
 44SC5c  or greater than the smallest uncertainty of the values used to

 45CA3cG 1980Hu10 obtained a precise value for the 174|g by a separate high-gain
 45CA4cG run with simultaneous storage of {+133}Ba and {+152}Eu sources; this

 45CA cG E(E)      The coincidence gate included a 511|g component which was    
 45CA2cG also observed as a coincidence |g. The coincident 1706|g was observed  
 45CA3cG along with the single- and double-escape peaks. Only the single- and   
 45CA4cG double-escape peaks of the coincident 2354|g were observed and only the
 45CA5cG double-escape peak of the 2597|g was observed in this gate. The gate on
 45CA6cG the 512|g showed an unexpected enhancement of the 1706|g. Therefore,   
 45CA7cG 1980Hu10 postulate that the 512|g was a transition between the 2392-   
 45CA8cG and 1880-keV states.

 46TI c            An independent evaluation of this decay was carried out      
 46TI2c       by R. G. Helmer as part of the international Decay Data           
 46TI3c       Evaluation Project.  Since the results are very similar to those  
 46TI4c       given in this data set, they are included in this comment, rather 
 46TI5c       than replacing the data set.  From the analysis of 5 half-life    
 46TI5c       values by three different methods (1985ZiZY 1992Ra08) ,           
 46TI6c       a result of 83.788 d {I22} is obtained.  The intensities          
 46TI7c       of the 889- and 1120-keV |g rays are deduced to be 99.9833 {I5}   
 46TI8c       and 99.986 {I+4-36}, respectivively.  The |g-ray energies can     
 46TI9c       be replaced by 889.271 {I2} and 1120.537 {I3} from the            
 46TI0c       2000He14 evaluation.  The details of this evaluation will be

 47K 2c  protons/pulse) from the PSB accelerator impinging on a standard ISOLDE 
 47K 3c  uranium carbide graphite target, heated to about 1900|' C. The         
 47K 4c  reaction products diffused from the heated target and effused {Ivia} a 
 47K 5c  low-temperature, water-cooled transfer line to a standard FEBIAD MK-7  
 47K 6c  plasma ion source, where the ionization by plasma discharge took       
 47K 7c  place. A tungsten converter was placed parallel to the target,         
 47K 8c  allowing one to switch to the neutron irradiation of the target by     
 47K 9c  changing the focus of the proton beam from the target to the           
 47K Ac  converter. Measured E|g, E|b, I|g, I|b, |g|g- and |b|g-coin, and

 47K  c  The level scheme is tentative as stated by 2004We09. The position of   
 47K 2c  first two excited states and their transitions were known from         
 47K 3c  {+48}Ca({+48}Ca,X|g). 1742|g and 3822|g placed according to coincidence
 47K 4c  relations. The relatively strong 3718 is not observed in coincidence   
 47K 5c  with other |g's and, therefore, assumed to deexcite the 3718 state.    
 47K 6c  2020|g, 3420|g, and 3357|g placed solely on their energies.            
 47K  cB IB        All branching ratios are normalized based on the total decay 
 47K 2cB strength deduced from intensities of the |g's from {+47}K decay.

 47K 2cB assumed first-forbidden unique transition as stated by 2004WeZY.       
 47K  cB LOGFT(B)  Too low for |DJ=2, no transition. Feeding considered as      
 47K 2cB questionable by the evaluator                                          
 47K  cB IB(D)     Observed {+47}K activity corresponds to the buildup of the   
 47K 2cB {+47}Ar daughter. Therefore, intensities of the 586|g and 2013 |g of   
 47K 3cB {+47}K represent 79% and 93% of the total {+47}Ar decay flux,          
 47K 4cB respectively. The total strength of {+47}Ar decay measured in these    
 47K 5cB |g's is 174 {I13} in the same relative units as given for the {+47}Ar  
 47K 6cB decay |g's. This value should be compared to the |SI|g(to g.s.), 128   
 47K 7cB {I3}. Undetected decay to the g.s. is assumed to be responsible for    
 47K 8cB the rest of the decay strength, 46 {I13}, which corresponds to a 26%   
 47K xcB {I8} decay branching to the g.s.

 48TI2c  The |b{+-} decay of {+48}Ca to {+48}Sc is suppressed due to the        
 48TI3c  angular momentum conservation law (J|p({+48}Ca, g.s.)=0+ and           
 48TI4c  J|p({+48}Sc,g.s.)=6+) and the 2|b{+-} decay has the largest available  
 48TI5c  energy release for all 2|b candidates (Q(2|b{+-})=4.274 MeV {I4}) that 
 48TI6c  is higher than most of the radioactive backgrounds. Therefore, the     
 48TI7c  large space factor compensates for a relatively small nuclear matrix   
 48TI8c  element. See 1993Mo36 for a review of 2|b{+-} decay searches. Others:

 51V 3c       Decay Data Evaluation Project(DDEP).  Since the results are very  
 51V 4c       similar, they are included in this comment, rather than           
 51V 5c       replacing the data set.  From the analysis of 21 half-life        
 51V 6c       values, a result of 27.703 d {I3} is obtained.  From 9 values,

 51V 9c       2000He14 and the half-life reference of 1991UnZZ,1992Un01 can be

 52CA7c  energy neutrons detected using using six detectors each composed of    
 52CA8c  a thick BC400 plastic scintillator. High energy neutrons were detected 
 52CA9c  using 11 curved BC400 scintillating plastic bars from the TONNERRE     
 52CAAc  array. The |b particles were detected using a cylindrical plastic      
 52CABc  scintillator.

 57CR4cL comment in 'adopted levels', where 892.5|g and 1314.3|g                
 57CR5cL are placed from two separate levels based on above discrepancy         
 57CR6cL in energy sum and on results from {+14}C({+48}Ca,ang) reaction.

 61MN3c  coupled cyclotrons at the National Superconducting Cyclotron           
 61MN4c  Laboratory at Michigan State University. Fragments were separated

 61MN2c  beam incident on a Be target, FRS spectrometer at GSI facility.

 61FE c  2013Ra17: {+61}Mn produced in induced fission of uranium at ISOLDE-CERN
 61FE2c  facility. E(proton)=1.4 GeV beam impinged a UC{-x} target of thickness 
 61FE3c  45 g/cm{+2}. Reaction products where ionized by RILIS and              
 61FE4c  separated based on their A/Q ratio using a High-Resolution Separator.  
 61FE5c  {+61}Mn obtained in the reaction was implanted on an aluminized mylar  
 61FE6c  tape for the decay. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, half-life using      
 61FE7c  three plastic |DE |b detectors and two MiniBall |g-detector clusters.  
 61FE8c  Deduced levels, J, |p, |b feeding intensities, log| {Ift}. Comparison  
 61FE9c  with {+59}Fe data, and with shell-model calculations.                  
 61FE c  1985Ru05: first identification of {+61}Mn from fragmentation of {+82}Se
 61FE2c  beam at 11.5 MeV/nucleon on tungsten target using on-line mass         
 61FE3c  separator. Measured E|g, I|g, |b|g-, |g|g-coin, and T{-1/2} by Ge(Li)  
 61FE4c  and plastic scintillator. Three excited states at 207, 391 and 629 keV 
 61FE5c  were proposed through the observation of five |g rays                  
 61FE c  1999Ha05: 1-GeV proton -induced spallation of uranium UC{-2} target    
 61FE2c  at ISOLDE-CERN facility. The laser ionized Mn isotopes were extracted  
 61FE3c  from the ion source and mass separated. Using tape systems measured    
 61FE4c  |b-delayed neutron multiscaling, E|g and |g|g coincidence. |b-delayed  
 61FE5c  neutron data were collected by multiscaling measurements using

 62CU2c  proposed by 1973Gi01 since the 1142|g is in coincidence with the 247|g.

 62CU4c  decay |g rays (1977Ch04) are not observed in any studies of {+62}Zn    
 62CU5c  decay - concluded that feeding of the 1142 level by {+62}Zn decay is

 63MN4c  daughter and grand-daughter nuclei, the |b-efficiency and the

 70CO c  2013Ma87: {+70}Fe activity produced in fragmentation of a {+86}Kr      
 70CO2c  beam at E=140 MeV/nucleon on a {+9}Be target. Isotopes separated with  
 70CO3c  the A1900 spectrometer and identified through |DE and time-of-flight   
 70CO4c  measurements. Measured E|g, I|g, |b|g coincidences using the SeGA      
 70CO5c  array consisting of 12 segmented HPGe detectors and a DSSD.            
 70CO c  A single 274|g is observed in the |b-gated spectrum correlated with a  
 70CO2c  {+70}Fe implant. This could correspond to the |b{+-} or |b{+-}n        
 70CO3c  decay of {+70}Fe. Since a 273.2 {I5} transition is observed to         
 70CO4c  depopulate the 54-ns isomer in {+70}Co, 2013Ma87 tentatively place     
 70CO5c  the 274|g as belonging to the |b{+-} decay.  However, this then        
 70CO6c  creates a discrepancy with the proposed J|p=(4-) assignment to the     
 70CO7c  54-ns isomer, as population from the 0+ ground state of {+70}Fe is

 71NI5c  and levels were proposed at 281 (or 253), 489 (or 461), 1055           
 71NI6c  (or 1027) and 1308 with J|p=(7/2+), (1/2-), (5/2-) and (5/2-),         
 71NI7c  respectively, based on shell-model considerations and comparisons      
 71NI8c  with {+69}Ni level scheme                                              
 71NI c  The level scheme given here is from 2010RaZY, which is primarily based 
 71NI2c  on a |g|g cascade observed in coincidence and two |g rays from (5/2-)  
 71NI3c  levels feeding the 1/2- isomer in analogy with the decay scheme of     
 71NI4c  {+69}Co to {+69}Ni proposed in 1999Mu17. Other scenarios for the       
 71NI5c  placement of 566 and 774 |g rays have been considered in 2010RaZY but  
 71NI6c  ruled out on the basis of unacceptable transition rates and/or lack    
 71NI7c  of |g|g coincidence correlations                                       
 71NI c  2010RaZY mention an additional experiment at NSCL (reference 40 in     
 71NI2c  2010RaZY) dealing with an on-line spectroscopy for {+71}Ni in a        
 71NI3c  knockout reaction on {+73}Cu beam and probably {+9}Be target, where    
 71NI4c  281-, 566- and 813-keV |g rays were seen, none of these in coincidence 
 71NI5c  mode. This observation confirms the placement of these |g rays in      
 71NI6c  {+71}Co

 71NI3c  and 1273, (5/2-) from a priv comm (reference 22 in 2009St07). The 281, 
 71NI4c  566 and 774 |g rays were also seen by 2009St07, depicted in spectral

 71NI c  The decay scheme given here is considered as incomplete by the         
 71NI2c  evaluators, thus no attempt has been made to normalize the decay scheme
 71NI3c  to obtain absolute emission intensities, |b feedings and log| {Ift}

 71ZN3c  A 1298|g was seen in coin with 490|g and seven |g rays were shown

 71ZN5c  there were discrepancies between their data and those from 1983Ru06,   
 71ZN6c  but details of this study are not yet available.                       
 71ZN c  The decay scheme given here from 1983Ru06 is considered incomplete     
 71ZN2c  in view of a gap of about 2.2 MeV between Q value and the highest level
 71ZN3c  at 2377 keV, where additional levels and |g rays could be present.     
 71ZN4c  Moreover, some |g-ray spectra shown by 1999Pr10 show additional        
 71ZN5c  transitions assigned to this decay, albeit, unplaced at present.       
 71ZN cB IB,LOGFT$ As explained above in the header comments of the dataset,    
 71ZN2cB the decay scheme is incomplete, thus all |b feedings are considered as 
 71ZN3cB upper limits and associated log {Ift} values as lower limits.

 72NI c  The decay scheme is incomplete, fewer |g rays than what would be       
 72NIac  expected from a decay with a Q(|b{+-})value of nearly 15 MeV were      
 72NIac  reported, and the %|b{+-}n in {+72}Co is not precisely known. As a     
 72NIac  result, absolute intensities can not be obtained. Estimates of the     
 72NIac  |b{+-} intensities can be made by assuming that the absolute gamma ray 
 72NIac  intensity of the 1096|g is about 100%, therefore the I(|b{+-}) to the  
 72NIac  3593 level will be |?30%, and the I(|b{+-}) to the 2396 level will be  
 72NIac  |?24%. The intensities of the 845- and 1096-keV |g rays are            
 72NIac  inconsistent with the decay scheme shown here. However, they suggest   
 72NIac  the existence of |b{+-} population to levels that have not been        
 72NIac  observed but that gamma decay to the 1941-keV level, thus increasing   
 72NIac  the intensities of these two |g rays.

 72ZNacL taken to be negligible on the assumption that the spin of {+72}Cu is

 72ZNacL Simply because the experimental conditions in 2006Th12 were            
 72ZNacL considerable better than in 1983Ru06, we are adopting the results of

 75ZN c  2011Il01: {+75}Cu beam produced from fission of {+238}U                
 75ZN2c  with protons at Holifield Radioactive Ion beam facility. Mass          
 75ZN3c  and isobaric separation of the beam with a high-resolution system.     
 75ZN4c  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g and |b|g coin, isotopic half-life using four   
 75ZN5c  HPGe Clover Ge detectors for |g rays and two plastic scintillators for 
 75ZN6c  |b particles. Level scheme deduced from detailed |g|g coin data        
 75ZN cB IB$ 2011Il01 list only strong |b feedings to 345, 420, 476, 725, 1144, 
 75ZN2cB and 2906 levels. Others are deduced by the evaluators. These feedings  
 75ZN3cB should be considered as apparent values since about 35% |b feeding     
 75ZN4cB remains unaccounted. Note that |g rays with uncertain placements are   
 75ZN5cB not included by the evaluators in obtaining intensity balances         
 75ZN cB LOGFT$ Deduced by the evaluators using log| {Ift} code. Due to         
 75ZN2cB incomplete decay scheme, these values should be considered as          
 75ZN3cB approximate, thus no uncertainties are listed here

 75ZN cB IB(B)$ 7.9 {I17} in 2011Il01 for feeding to 2904.6+2906.5 levels       
 75ZN cG RI$ Uncertainties quoted in 2011Il01 are statistical only, as          
 75ZN2cG communicated to the evaluators by the first author in an e-mail reply. 
 75ZN3cG The evaluators have assigned minimum of 1% uncertainty to take into    
 75ZN4cG account systematic uncertainties arising from efficiency calibration   
 75ZN5cG and peak fitting procedures                                            
 75ZN cG TI(D)$ From intensity balance at 152 level. There may be direct |b     
 75ZN2cG feeding also which is not taken into account (evaluators' comment)     
 75ZN cG E(E)$ Poor fit, level-energy difference=1754.5                         
 75ZN cG RI(F)$ Uncertainty quoted as 0.6 in 2011Il01 seems a misprint. The     
 75ZN2cG evaluators assign 0.06

 77ZN5c  an ionization chamber and a moving tape collector.                     
 77ZN3c  In one experiment, the Cu ions were accelerated to 225 MeV and

 77ZN4c  Resonant Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS) and General Purpose       
 77ZN5c  mass separator (GPS) at the CERN-ISOLDE facility. The separated

 77ZN7c  surrounded by three E-|DE plastic detectors for |b-particle detection  
 77ZN8c  and two HPGe detectors. Measured |g, |b, |b|g coin, |b|b coin,         
 77ZN9c  |g|g coin and delayed-neutron events. The neutrons were detected with  
 77ZNAc  the Mainz neutron long counter. Major contribution to |g-ray and       
 77ZNBc  |b spectra are from {+77}Ga decay as indicated by a comparison of      
 77ZNCc  'laser-on' and 'laser-off' spectra. In both the spectra, lines from    
 77ZNDc  {+77}Ga are quite prominent. The decay scheme of {+77}Ga is poorly
